Despite his protestations, Western technology endured and helped to make India one of the leading economies in our globalized world. Few would question the dominant role that technology plays in modern life, but to fully understand how India first advanced into technological modernity, argues David Arnold, we must consider the technology of the everyday.</p> <p> </p> <p><i>Everyday Technology</i> is a pioneering account of how small machines and consumer goods that originated in Europe and North America became objects of everyday use in India in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. Rather than investigate &#x201c;big&#x201d; technologies such as railways and irrigation projects, Arnold examines the assimilation and appropriation of bicycles, rice mills, sewing machines, and typewriters in India, and follows their impact on the ways in which people worked and traveled, the clothes they wore, and the kind of food they ate. But the effects of these machines were not limited to the daily rituals of Indian society, and Arnold demonstrates how such small-scale technologies became integral to new ways of thinking about class, race, and gender, as well as about the politics of colonial rule and Indian nationhood.</p> <p> </p> <p>Arnold&#x2019;s fascinating book offers new perspectives on the globalization of modern technologies and shows us that to truly understand what modernity became, we need to look at the everyday experiences of people in all walks of life, taking stock of how they repurposed small technologies to reinvent their world and themselves.</p> <br></p><p><b>David Arnold </b>is professor emeritus of Asian and global history in the Department of History at the University of Warwick. Among his numerous works are <i>Science, Technology and Medicine in Colonial India</i>; <i>Gandhi</i>; and <i>The Tropics and the Traveling Gaze: India, Landscape, and Science, 1800&#x2013;1856</i>.&#x201c;<i>Everyday Technology</i> organizes an enormous amount of unfamiliar detail on a hitherto largely neglected subject, reinforced with copious statistics and illustrated with some appealing historical and contemporary images. It is enlivened by apt quotations from novels and films of the period.&#x201d; (Andrew Robinson <i>Nature</i>)<br><br>"In this fascinating study, David Arnold casts his eye over a range of much smaller and humbler machines which, nonetheless, have transformed the &#x201c;everyday&#x201d; lives of the people using them. He explores the histories of the bicycle, the sewing machine, the typewriter, the gramophone and the rice mill in the context of colonial India." (<i>Times Literary Supplement</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Fascinating.&#x201d; (V. V. Raman, Rochester Institute of Technology <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Arnold paints a detailed and informative picture of the diffusion and adoption of four &#x2018;small&#x2019; technologies embodied in the sewing machine, the bicycle, the typewriter, and the rice mill. Given the smaller size and scope of these goods, and the uses that they were put to, the author&#x2019;s narrative does not remain mired in the sterile world of officialdom. Instead, he is incessantly led, by the very nature of the task at hand, into the homes, offices, and streets of colonial India; into the life and world of the common man. This focus on the subaltern world, far away from the centers of power, and the author&#x2019;s masterful rendition of it in lucid prose, is one of the highlights of the book. . . . An interesting and informative work that all students of Indian economic history can read with both profit and pleasure. . . . Arnold&#x2019;s book is bound to provide an enlightening glimpse into the lives of the common man and his relationship with technology during the later years of British rule in India.&#x201d; (G. P. Manish, Troy University <i>EH.Net</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Exploring small technologies that swiftly passed into the realm of everyday life in India, David Arnold&#x2019;s remarkable book offers nothing less than a new perspective on technology and modernity. Clear, insightful, and compelling from start to finish, <i>Everyday Technology</i> uses the sewing machine, typewriter, bicycle, and rice mill to offer us a history of the &#x2018;subaltern engagement with the machine&#x2019; that brings to life the ways that ordinary people wove such new technologies into their everyday existence under conditions of colonialism. Arnold&#x2019;s attention to the small allows a street-level view of the relationships between technology and race, gender, class, and authority. His focus on ordinary technologies in ordinary life paradoxically provides a deeper understanding of the profundity of the social and technological transformations taking place, adding texture to our understanding of the character and emergence of technological modernities in the twentieth century.&#x201d;<br> (Suzanne Moon, University of Oklahoma)<br><br>&#x201c;In an age that has been captivated by the potential and perils of the large-scale, fossil fuel&#x2013;driven technologies of the industrial watershed, David Arnold reminds us of the pervasive impact of more modest but nonetheless ingenious machines. Drawing on a diverse range of sources and compelling case examples, he explores the transformative effects of small-scale technologies, including bicycles and sewing machines, on the politics, production, social relations, and everyday lives of the peoples of India&#x2014;and implicitly those of most of humanity over the past half millennium.&#x201d; (Michael Adas, Rutgers, The State University of New Jersey)<br><br>&#x201c;David Arnold&#x2019;s brilliant and imaginative history of everyday technology effectively refashions the very story of India&#x2019;s modernity. The ubiquitous bicycle, the once-popular mechanical sewing machine, the still extant typewriter, and the rice mill that straddles rural-urban divides have all found their historian in the author of <i>Colonizing the Body</i>. Arnold has, once again, broken new ground in South Asian history.&#x201d; (Dipesh Chakrabarty, University of Chicago)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Everyday Technology</i> is a lucid, engaging work on acculturation of modern technology in India. Rather than focusing on the usual &#x2018;big&#x2019; projects such as railways and hydroelectric plants that require large capital investment, David Arnold takes on the &#x2018;small&#x2019; technologies of modern life that changed the everyday lives of millions of Indians. He thus shifts the focus on agency in the history of technology: from inventors to adapters and users, and from an emphasis on how the imperial West viewed its technological other to how India &#x2018;imagined itself.&#x2019; Arnold&#x2019;s erudition and imagination will be attractive to both scholars and lay audiences.&#x201d;<br> (Swati Chattopadhyay, University of California, Santa Barbara)</p><h2>Conjuring Culture: Biblical Formations of Black America (Religion in America)</h2><p>This book provides a sophisticated new interdisciplinary interpretation of the formulation and evolution of African American religion and culture. Theophus Smith argues for the central importance of "conjure"--a magical means of transforming reality--in black spirituality and culture. Smith shows that the Bible, the sacred text of Western civilization, has in fact functioned as a magical formulary for African Americans. Going back to slave religion, and continuing in black folk practice and literature to the present day, the Bible has provided African Americans with ritual prescriptions for prophetically re-envisioning, and thereby transforming, their history and culture. In effect the Bible is a "conjure book" for prescribing cures and curses, and for invoking extraordinary and Divine powers to effect changes in the conditions of human existence--and to bring about justice and freedom. Biblical themes, symbols, and figures like Moses, the Exodus, the Promised Land, and the Suffering Servant, as deployed by African Americans, have crucially formed and reformed not only black culture, but American society as a whole. Smith examines not only the religious and political uses of conjure, but its influence on black aesthetics, in music, drama, folklore, and literature. The concept of conjure, he shows, is at the heart of an indigenous and still vital spirituality, with exciting implications for reformulating the next generation of black studies and black theology. Even more broadly, Smith proposes, "conjuring culture" can function as a new paradigm for understanding Western religious and cultural phenomena generally.<br></p><p>Theophus Smith is Associate Professor of Religion at Emory University.<br>"A highly original and very creative text....Will represent a new kind of African-American religious scholarship."--Albert J. Raboteau, <em>Princeton University</em><p></p><br>"Promises not only to move African American religious studies to a new stage but also to provide a kind of 'healing book' of his own for a contemporary culture in which racial antagonism has again poisoned the body politic."--<em>The Cresset</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Plays: New Translation: The Cherry Orchard, Three Sisters, The Seagull and Uncle Vanya (Evergreens)</h2><p><p>The most widely staged dramatist after Shakespeare, Chekhov left a deep mark both on the development of Russian literature and world theatre, with plays that were remarkable not just for their dialogue but their atmosphere and the tensions expressed between the lines. </p><p>Collected in this volume are Chekhov's four most celebrated plays &#x2013; The Seagull, Uncle Vanya, Three Sisters and The Cherry Orchard &#x2013; in a brand-new translation by Hugh Aplin. In these personal stories of unfulfilled love, failed ambition and existential ennui, set against a background of unsettling social and economical change, the reader can appreciate the groundbreaking qualities of Chekhov's theatrical genius.</p></p><p>Anton Chekhov (1860&#x2013;1904) is one of the giants of modern literature, exerting a strong influence on many present-day novelists and dramatists. As a playwright, he ranks in popularity second only to Shakespeare in the English-speaking world. As a prose writer, he was one of the first to use the stream-of- consciousness technique, and his anti-heroic realism, full of ambiguity and allusion, provides no easy moral conclusions and results in a new kind of narrative approaching real life in a way no writer had achieved before him.&#34;What writers influenced me as a young man?

It was Daniel who changed his name to De Foe or Defoe in about 1705. He was interested in politics and opposed King James II. After the Glorious Revolution in 1688 and William III was on the throne, Defoe became one of his personal friends. He became a writer for the government and a satircal writer on various social issues of the time. He turned to full time writing after hearing the inspirational story of a sailor who was rescued after living alone on a desert island in the Pacific, the result being his first novel ROBINSON CRUSOE. Several other adventure stories followed, including MOLL FLANDERS.</p><h2>From Mineralogy to Geology: The Foundations of a Science, 1650-1830 (Science and Its Conceptual Foundations series)</h2><p>"A fine treatment of this critical time in geology's history.

Lipps, <i>The Scientist</i></p><p>Geology, according to most histories of the field, emerged as a separate scientific specialty in early nineteenth-century Britain, where its practitioners attempted to understand the development of the earth&#39;s crust and to free geology from the Biblical account of creation.

Surprisingly, he could never control his body's lethal addiction to tobacco, and the doctor underwent 22 operations for cancer of the palate.

In building this narrative, Bodnar shows how the idealism of President Franklin Roosevelt's Four Freedoms was lost in the public commemoration of World War II, how the war's memory became intertwined in the larger discussion over American national identity, and how it only came to be known as the "good war" many years after its conclusion.</p></p><p><p>Praise for John Bodnar's <i>Blue-Collar Hollywood</i></p><p>"An uncommonly well balanced account of the political biases of American movies...

The gallery&#x2019;s dense display of botanical paintings are arranged geographically, allowing viewers to wander from pole to pole by examining the diverse plants that cover the globe. The paintings also hint at the story of their remarkable creator, Marianne North. Born in England in 1830, North refused to be limited to the domestic spaces to which Victorian women were so often confined. Rather, her travels took her to Ceylon, Japan, and Brazil, and she documented the plants she encountered along the way. Her detailed renderings of plants that few were able to see in person provided critical information for the growing science of botany, and many now bear her name as a tribute to her intrepid discoveries. What&#x2019;s more, the paintings she made are a colorful record of the beauty that covers the earth in its diverse plants.<br><br> For the first time, this collection is now accessible to a wide public in book form. All the paintings that hang in the gallery&#x2014;more than eight hundred in total&#x2014;are included in this spectacular book. Organized&nbsp;geographically to correspond with the collection&#x2019;s representation at Kew, this book allows us all to relive North&#x2019;s remarkable travels and thrilling discoveries, relishing the world&#x2019;s lush and diverse plants.</p><p>For more than 250 years, the <b>Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew</b> has fostered the study of plant diversity and economic botany.</p><h2>Mathematical Discovery: On Understanding, Learning and Teaching Problem Solving Combined Edition</h2><p><p><b>A unique, heuristic approach to mathematical discovery and problem solving</b></p> <p>This combined edition of <i>Mathematical Discovery: On Understanding, Learning and Teaching Problem Solving</i> is unique among mathematics texts.

It goes to the heart of where good ideas for teaching of good writing originate: from yourself and your own experience.</p> <p>As Katie shows, the most profound and effective curriculum can result from your own deep understanding of quality writing-what you know about writing through your own and others' writings and through your reading. And the best teaching can result from what you can wrap your heart and mind around and communicate to your students. It is this very personal approach and contagious enthusiasm that Katie brings to bear on creating curriculum for her own writing workshops. Her book shows how you can do it for your own.</p> <p>In Part One, Katie takes a close look at the lines of thinking you can use to find curriculum in your own writing experiences. In Part Two, she shows how to use the same lines of thinking to find curriculum in your everyday reading life. Along with her own inimitable writing style, Katie sprinkles special features throughout her book as helpful tips for thinking about your own writing workshop and curriculum development, including:</p> <ul> <li>minilessons and "curriculum chunks"</li> <li>"Thinking it Through" boxes with questions and things to try</li> <li>"understandings" and strategies</li> <li>notebook-keeping tips accompanied by Katie's own handwritten journal entries </li> <li>transcripts of interviews with writers</li> <li>references for further reading.</li> </ul> <p>Follow Katie's example.

Wagner</i></p><h2>Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems</h2><p><p><b>A solid, quantitative, practical introduction to a wide range of renewable energy systems&#x2015;in a completely updated, new edition</b></p> <p>The second edition of <i>Renewable and Efficient Electric Power Systems</i> provides a solid, quantitative, practical introduction to a wide range of renewable energy systems. For each topic, essential theoretical background is introduced, practical engineering considerations associated with designing systems and predicting their performance are provided, and methods for evaluating the economics of these systems are presented. While the book focuses on the fastest growing, most promising wind and solar technologies, new material on tidal and wave power, small-scale hydroelectric power, geothermal and biomass systems is introduced. Both supply-side and demand-side technologies are blended in the final chapter, which introduces the emerging smart grid. As the fraction of our power generated by renewable resources increases, the role of demand-side management in helping maintain grid balance is explored.</p> <p>Renewable energy systems have become mainstream technologies and are now, literally, big business. Throughout this edition, more depth has been provided on the financial analysis of large-scale conventional and renewable energy projects. While grid-connected systems dominate the market today, off-grid systems are beginning to have a significant impact on emerging economies where electricity is a scarce commodity. Considerable attention is paid to the economics of all of these systems.</p> <p>This edition has been completely rewritten, updated, and reorganized. New material has been presented both in the form of new topics as well as in greater depth in some areas. The section on the fundamentals of electric power has been enhanced, making this edition a much better bridge to the more advanced courses in power that are returning to many electrical engineering programs. This includes an introduction to phasor notation, more emphasis on reactive power as well as real power, more on power converter and inverter electronics, and more material on generator technologies. Realizing that many students, as well as professionals, in this increasingly important field may have modest electrical engineering backgrounds, early chapters develop the skills and knowledge necessary to understand these important topics without the need for supplementary materials.</p> <p>With numerous completely worked examples throughout, the book has been designed to encourage self-instruction. The book includes worked examples for virtually every topic that lends itself to quantitative analysis. Each chapter ends with a problem set that provides additional practice. This is an essential resource for a mixed audience of engineering and other technology-focused individuals.</p></p><p><p><b>GILBERT M.

Marilyn Chin&#x2019;s passionate, polyphonic poetry travels freely from the personal to the mythic, from the political to the spiritual. Deeply engaged with the complexities of cultural assimilation, feminism, and the Asian American experience, she spins precise, beautiful metaphors as she illuminates hard-hitting truths.</p><p><em>A Portrait of the Self as Nation</em> celebrates Chin&#x2019;s innovative activist poetry: her fearless and often confrontational early collections, <em>Dwarf Bamboo</em> and <em>The Phoenix Gone, the Terrace Empty</em>; the rebellious, vivid language of <em>Rhapsody in Plain Yellow</em>; and the erotic elegies of <em>Hard Love Province</em>. Also included are excerpts from Chin&#x2019;s daring novel, <em>Revenge of the Mooncake Vixen</em>, and a vibrant chapter of new poems and translations.</p><p>In poems that are direct and passionately charged, Marilyn Chin raises her voice against systems of oppression even as her language shines with devastating power and beauty. Image after image, line by line, Chin&#x2019;s masterfully reinvented quatrains, sonnets, allegories, and elegies are unforgettable.</p></p><p>Marilyn Chin was born in Hong Kong.

Presently, she serves as a chancellor of the Academy of American Poets and lives in San Diego.&#x201c;These poems have a fearless life on every page, moving big themes into language, and pointing to past silences. But for all its sociable music, this poetry is also a serious and moving meditation on an inner life. Not simply the inner life of the poet but also&#x2015;as the title suggests&#x2015;the inner life of the nation that poet recognizes. This work is poised over both the public spaces where art and ethics are made, as well as the private reaches of a self where&#x2015;as the poems show&#x2015;an Asian American woman can weigh both identity and freedom. Marilyn Chin is a major voice. And this is a book to be treasured.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Eavan Boland</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Marilyn Chin&#x2019;s poems excite and incite the imagination through their brilliant cultural interfacings, their theatre of anger, &#x2018;fierce and tender,&#x2019; their compassion, and their high mockery of wit. Reading her, our sense of the possibilities of poetry is opened further, and we feel again what an active, powerful art it can be.&#x201d;<br> - <strong>Adrienne Rich</strong><br><br>&#x201c;Marilyn Mei Ling Chin draws on ancient cultural sources and at the same time reflects something wholly Western, urban, and contemporary&#x2015;so that we have here two kinds of sophistication combined, in proportions uniquely determined by her strong personal sensibility.

Featuring a Dickensian cast of pubcrawlers, prostitutes, lowlifes, and just plain losers who are looking for love&#x2014;or just an ear to bend&#x2014;Hamilton&#x2019;s novels are a triumph of deft characterization, offbeat humor, unlikely compassion, and raw suspense. In recent years, Hamilton has undergone a remarkable revival, with his champions including Doris Lessing, David Lodge,&nbsp;Nick Hornby, and Sarah Waters.<br><br><i>Twenty Thousand Streets Under the Sky</i> is a tale of obsession and betrayal that centers on a seedy pub in a run-down part of London. Bob the waiter skimps and saves and fantasizes about writing a novel, until he falls for the pretty prostitute Jenny and blows it all. Kindly Ella, Bob&#x2019;s co-worker, adores Bob, but is condemned to enjoy nothing more than the attentions of the insufferable Mr. Eccles; Jenny, out on the street, is out of love, hope, and money. We watch with pity and horror as these three vulnerable and yet compellingly ordinary people meet and play out bitter comedies of longing and frustration.</p><p>A timeless classic of sleazy London life in the 1930s, a world of streets, full of cruelty and kindness, comedy and pathos, where people emerge from cheap lodgings in Pimlico to pour out their passions, hopes and despair in pubs and bars.<b>Patrick Hamilton</b> (1904&#x2014;1962) was born into a literary family and became active in the theater at a young age.

In their work on Africa and colonialism they have explored some of the fundamental questions of social science, delving into the nature of history and human agency, culture and consciousness, ritual and representation. How are human differences constructed and institutionalized, transformed and (sometimes) effaced, empowered and (sometimes) resisted? How do local cultures articulate with global forms? How is the power of some people over others built, sustained, eroded, and negated? How does the social imagination take shape in novel yet collectively meaningful ways?Addressing these questions, the essays in this volume several never before published work toward an imaginative sociology,&#x201d; demonstrating the techniques by which social science may capture the contexts that human beings construct and inhabit. In the introduction, the authors offer their most complete statement to date on the nature of historical anthropology. Standing apart from the traditional disciplines of social history and modernist social science, their work is dedicated to discovering how human worlds are made and signified, forgotten and remade.</p><p><b>John Comaroff</b> is professor of anthropology and sociology at the University of Chicago, where <b>Jean Comaroff</b> is professor of anthropology.</p><h2>Exemplary Novels (The Margellos World Republic of Letters)</h2><p><b>Edith Grossman, celebrated for her brilliant translation of <i>Don Quixote</i>, offers a dazzling new version of another Cervantes classic, on the 400th anniversary of his death &nbsp;</b><br><br> The twelve novellas gathered together in <i>Exemplary Novels</i> reveal the extraordinary breadth of Cervantes&#x2019;s imagination: his nearly limitless ability to create characters, invent plots, and entertain readers across continents and centuries. Cervantes published his book in Spain in 1613. The assemblage of unique characters (eloquent witches, talking dogs, Gypsy orphans, and an array of others), the twisting plots, and the moral heart at the core of each tale proved irresistible to his enthusiastic audience. Then as now, Cervantes&#x2019;s readers find pure entertainment in his pages, but also a subtle artistry that invites deeper investigation. Edith Grossman&#x2019;s eagerly awaited translation brings this timeless classic to English-language readers in an edition that will delight those already familiar with Cervantes&#x2019;s work as well as those about to be enchanted for the first time.

The text follows a more visual approach by integrating maps, photos, realia, and cultural notes that offer a vibrant image of Italy. The chapters are organised around functions and activities. Cultural information has been updated to make the material more relevant. In addition, discussions on functional communications give readers early success in the language and encourage them to use it in practical situations. This communicative, culture-based introductory Italian text develops all five language skills by pairing cultural themes with essential grammar points and by organizing units around situations, functions, and regions of Italy. The authors' belief that language is culture and culture is language is best illustrated by the text's up-to-date, fresh image of Italy and Italians and by the successful integration of this philosophy as an active, key part of the learning experience. &nbsp;Parliamo italiano!, 4e brings Italy into the classroom, immersing the reader in the geography, customs, daily routines, literature, music and general culture of Italy, while providing a strong basis for development of basic language skills - reading, writing, speaking, listening and cultural competency.</p><p>Suzanne Branciforte teaches at the University of Genoa.

Robert Faulkner contends that too many modern accounts of leadership slight such things as determination to excel, good judgment, justice, and a sense of honor the very qualities that distinguish the truly great. And here he offers an attempt to recover a reasonable understanding of excellence,&#x201d; that which distinguishes a Franklin D. Roosevelt and a Lincoln from lesser leaders.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Faulkner finds the most telling diagnoses in antiquity and examines closely Aristotle&#x2019;s great-souled man, two accounts of the spectacular and dubious Athenian politician Alcibiades, and the life of the imperial conqueror Cyrus the Great. There results a complex and compelling picture of greatness and its problems. Faulkner dissects military and imperial ambition, the art of leadership, and, in the later example of George Washington, ambition in the service of popular self-government. He also addresses modern indictments of even the best forms of political greatness, whether in the critical thinking of Hobbes, the idealism of Kant, the relativism and brutalism of Nietzsche, or the egalitarianism of Rawls and Arendt. He shows how modern philosophy came to doubt and indeed disdain even the best forms of ambition. This book is a nuanced defense of admirable ambition and the honor-seeking life, as well as an irresistible invitation to apply these terms to our own times and leaders.</p></p><p><p>Robert Faulkner is professor of political science at Boston College.</p>"The classic philosophers, Faulkner contends, help us far more than modern theoreticians to make sense of genuinely great men and women. The chapter on Aristotle's 'megalopsychos' is the best I have read in any of the literatures and Faulkner does a masterful job of focusing on the inner-life of the great-souled man, not just the desire for honors, but the desire to be worthy of honors. An excellent study of a much-needed subject."&#x2014;Steven Smith, author of <i>Reading Leo Strauss</i> and <i>Spinoza's Book of Life</i> (Steven Smith)<br><br>&#x201c;Deftly mixing history, theory, and witty common sense, Robert Faulkner makes a compelling case for honorable ambition&#x2014;as distinct from both radical egalitarianism and amoral elitism&#x2014;in the service of republican self-government.&#x201d;&#x2014;William A. Galston, The Brookings Institution<br> (William A. Galston)<br><br>"In a searching study of politics and philosophy, Robert Faulkner defends honorable ambition against cynics and skeptics in our day. His search centers on the ancients, always our best source for greatness and its eternal rivalry with goodness.

Ward followed their trail and reported the incident to patrols at Fort Buchanan, blaming a band of Chiricahuas led by the infamous warrior Cochise. Though Ward had no proof that Cochise had kidnapped his son, Lt. George Bascom organized a patrol and met with the Apache leader, who, not suspecting anything was amiss, had brought along his wife, his brother, and two sons. Despite Cochise&#x2019;s assertions that he had not taken the boy and his offer to help in the search, Bascom immediately took Cochise&#x2019;s family hostage and demanded the return of the boy. An incensed Cochise escaped the meeting tent amidst flying bullets and vowed revenge.What followed that precipitous encounter would ignite a Southwestern frontier war between the Chiricahuas and the US Army that would last twenty-five years. In the days following the initial melee, innocent passersby&#x2015;Apache, white, and Mexican&#x2015;would be taken as hostages on both sides, and almost all of them would be brutally slaughtered. Cochise would lead his people valiantly for ten years of the decades-long war.Thousands of lives would be lost, the economies of Arizona and New Mexico would be devastated, and in the end, the Chiricahua way of life would essentially cease to exist.In a gripping narrative that often reads like an old-fashioned Western novel, Terry Mort explores the collision of these two radically different cultures in a masterful account of one of the bloodiest conflicts in our frontier history.</p><p>Terry Mort attended Princeton University, followed by graduate school at the University of Michigan. Afterward he served as an officer in the navy, specializing in navigation and gunnery. His service included a lengthy deployment to Vietnam. He is the author of The Hemingway Patrols&nbsp;and The Wrath of Cochise. He lives with his wife, Sondra Hadley, in Sonoita, Arizona and Durango, Colorado.In 1848, as a result of victory in the Mexican War, the U.S. acquired vast lands in the Southwest, but the U.S. government also inherited a chronic problem that had plagued Mexico for decades: the inability to contain the constant raiding and other depredations by various bands of Apaches. For the U.S., the problem would ebb and flow but would not be fully resolved for another four decades. Perhaps the most well-known and even admired Apache leader in this struggle was Cochise, who led the Chiricahua band. His particular dispute with Americans was supposedly triggered by a young and inexperienced lieutenant, Charles Bascom, who unjustly accused Cochise of kidnapping a young boy. Mort has written an absorbing and balanced account of the origins of the conflict that moves past much of the mythology surrounding it. For example, Cochise, though certainly a charismatic leader of his people, was also a brutal warrior who endorsed torture and the murder of innocents. The U.S. government and white settlers were equally capable of savagery. This is a well-done chronicle of a harsh war fought in a harsh environment. --Jay Freeman</p><h2>Turfgrass: Science and Culture</h2><p>A classic and best-selling text for sod and turfgrass courses covering lawnkeeping and athletic groundskeeping.</p><p></p><h2>Writings of St. Paul</h2><p><p><strong>The Second Edition of this perennially popular Norton Critical Edition is based on the Today&#x2019;s New International Version of Paul&#x2019;s letters, a new translation that is heralded for its inclusiveness and accuracy in representation of gender.</strong></p> This thoroughly revised and expanded edition includes an entirely new introduction to Paul and the central issues surrounding his writings, as well as several newly included sections of writings from Paul&#x2019;s time to the present, among them &#x201c;Annotated Text: Pseudo-Pauline Writings&#x201d;; &#x201c;The Apocryphal Paul: Some Early Christian Traditions and Legends,&#x201d; with writings by Jerome, Clement of Alexandria, Ambrosiaster, and others; &#x201c;The Martyrdom of Paul&#x201d;; &#x201c;Paul and His Pagan Critics;&#x201d; &#x201c;Valentinus and the Gnostic Paul,&#x201d;with writings by Theodotus and Elaine Pagels; &#x201c;Paul and the Christian Martyrs&#x201d;; &#x201c;A Sampler of Patristic Interpretations&#x201d;; &#x201c;The Second Century Paul&#x201d;; &#x201c;Reading Romans,&#x201d; with writings from Origen, Theodoret of Cyrus, Paul W.

Paleoclimate archives obtained through field investigations, ocean sediment coring expeditions, ice sheet coring programs, and other projects allow scientists to reconstruct climate change over much of earth's history. <br><br>When combined with computer model simulations, paleoclimatic reconstructions are used to test hypotheses about the causes of climatic change, such as greenhouse gases, solar variability, earth's orbital variations, and hydrological, oceanic, and tectonic processes. This book is a comprehensive, state-of-the art synthesis of paleoclimate research covering all geological timescales, emphasizing topics that shed light on modern trends in the earth's climate. Thomas M. Cronin discusses recent discoveries about past periods of global warmth, changes in atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, abrupt climate and sea-level change, natural temperature variability, and other topics directly relevant to controversies over the causes and impacts of climate change. This text is geared toward advanced undergraduate and graduate students and researchers in geology, geography, biology, glaciology, oceanography, atmospheric sciences, and climate modeling, fields that contribute to paleoclimatology.

That's because shortest-path routing protocols send traffic down the path that is shortest without considering other network parameters, such as utilization and traffic demands. Using Traffic Engineering (TE), network operators can redistribute packet flows to attain more uniform distribution across all links. Forcing traffic onto specific pathways allows you to get the most out of your existing network capacity while making it easier to deliver consistent service levels to customers at the same time. </p> <p>Cisco(r) Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) lends efficiency to very large networks, and is the most effective way to implement TE. MPLS TE routes traffic flows across the network by aligning resources required by a given flow with actual backbone capacity and topology. This constraint-based routing approach feeds the network route traffic down one or more pathways, preventing unexpected congestion and enabling recovery from link or node failures.</p> <p><i>Traffic Engineering with MPLS</i> provides you with information on how to use MPLS TE and associated features to maximize network bandwidth. This book focuses on real-world applications, from design scenarios to feature configurations to tools that can be used in managing and troubleshooting MPLS TE. Assuming some familiarity with basic label operations, this guide focuses mainly on the operational aspects of MPLS TE-how the various pieces work and how to configure and troubleshoot them. Additionally, this book addresses design and scalability issues along with extensive deployment tips to help you roll out MPLS TE on your own network.</p> <ul><li>Understand the background of TE and MPLS, and brush up on MPLS forwarding basics</li> <li>Learn about router information distribution and how to bring up MPLS TE tunnels in a network</li> <li>Understand MPLS TE's Constrained Shortest Path First (CSPF) and mechanisms you can use to influence CSPF's path calculation</li> <li>Use the Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP) to implement Label-Switched Path setup</li> <li>Use various mechanisms to forward traffic down a tunnel</li> <li>Integrate MPLS into the IP quality of service (QoS) spectrum of services</li> <li>Utilize Fast Reroute (FRR) to mitigate packet loss associated with link and node failures</li> <li>Understand Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP)-based measurement and accounting services that are available for MPLS</li> <li>Evaluate design scenarios for scalable MPLS TE deployments</li> <li>Manage MPLS TE networks by examining common configuration mistakes and utilizing tools for troubleshooting MPLS TE problems</li></ul> <p>"Eric and Ajay work in the development group at Cisco that built Traffic Engineering.

Lane shows that work, far from being a disutility, as economic theory would have it, is instead one of two major sources of lifetime satisfaction, and that money income, despite being a source of utility that compensates a person for his or her sacrifices at work, contributes very little to a sense of well-being. This reversal of the premises of market economics suggests a major, axial shift in the way we think about our economies. Lane proposes that the market be judged primarily by its capacity to yield two benefits: happiness and personal development, the latter defined as cognitive complexity, autonomy or a sense of being in control of one&#39;s own life, and self esteem. Traditional attention to production outputs and economic rewards has, says Lane, blinded us to the important ways in which the processes of production contribute to the two benefits of happiness and personal development. Lane lays the foundation for a form of economic analysis that attends to processes as well as outcomes and by drawing on psychology, sociology, and economic anthropology for extensive evidence employed to support his arguments, he provides the basis for a fundamental change in the way we think about economics and society. Robert Lane is the author of many books and articles, among them Political Life (1959) and Political Man (1972). He is a Past President of the American Political Science Association, Policy Studies Organization and International Society of Political Psychology.</p><p>Offering evidence that the major premises of market economics are mistaken, this analysis reveals that &#34;work&#34;, far from being a disutility as economic theory would have it, is instead one of two major sources of lifetime satisfaction."This will surely be one of the most important social science books of the 1990s and beyond. It bridges the social sciences with the ease and confidence only a mature scholar, at the top of his career and intellectual power, can accomplish...Lane writes clearly and powerfully and in terms we all can relate to. He is exceptionally erudite and he draws on, cites, and commands an incredible array of literature." Amitai Etzioni, George Washington University<br><br>"Eighteen years in the making and over 600 thickly annotated pages long, Roert Lane's monumental book is a unique and admirable achievement." Contemporary Sociology<br><br>"It provides an extremely impressive survey of the material, covering a psychological assessment of cognition, rationality, wage payments, social relations, and so on, all in a market context....In sum, this is an important and stimulating book." Geoff Hodgson, The Journal of Economic Issues<br><br>"In all seriousness, this is an extraordinary book in many ways. First, the sweep of its claims is breathtakingly broad and important: they will indeed revolutionize social science and social policy if given the attention they deserve. Second, an array of detailed analyses of social science literatures is brought to bear on the question of what actually happens as people experience the market. Lane analyzes hundreds of psychological experiments, opinion surveys, social theories, and philosophical treatises in the work of examining topics ranging from the meaning of rationality to the meaning of happiness, from the social role of money to the possibility of friendship. His ability to link these narrowly focused studies of particular locales to sweeping generalizations about human nature--and to do so most persuasively--is yet another extraordinary feature of The Market Experience." Jennifer L. Hochschild, American Political Science Review<br><br>"Lane has produced a most perceptive intellectual analysis of a major socioeconomic problem. He has raised highly significant questions about consequential issues and has pursued the scholarly literature with diligence and sophistication in his search for answers. And while not all readers will agree with his conclusions, few will go away unimpressed with the style and substance of his landmark contribution."

Nickel, Assistant Curator of Photography, the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art <p>In an 1828 letter to his partner, Nic�phore Ni�pce, Louis Daguerre wrote, "I am burning with desire to see your experiments from nature." In this book, Geoffrey Batchen analyzes the desire to photograph as it emerged within the philosophical and scientific milieus that preceded the actual invention of photography. Recent accounts of photography's identity tend to divide between the postmodern view that all identity is determined by context and a formalist effort to define the fundamental characteristics of photography as a medium. Batchen critiques both approaches by way of a detailed discussion of photography's conception in the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. In this refiguring of the traditional story of photography's origins, Batchen examines the output of the various nominees for "first photographer," then incorporates this information into a mode of historical criticism informed by the work of Michel Foucault and Jacques Derrida. The result is a way of thinking about photography that persuasively accords with the medium's undeniable conceptual, political, and historical complexity.</p></p><p>If, by 1725, all the chemical and optical necessities for the practice of photography already existed, why wasn't the art form invented until 1839? Geoffrey Batchen, an associate professor of art history and author of <i>Burning with Desire</i>, has an interesting answer: people simply weren't ready for it. Along with a blossoming in literature, philosophy, music, and science, the 18th century was also host to a whole new way of thinking about nature and landscape. The camera obscura, a portable box equipped with a lens or a mirror, was a popular tool that people used to first capture views and then trace them. The ability to reproduce a scene--however imperfectly--whet people's appetites for more exact methods, leading first to what Batchen calls the "proto-photographers," and then sometime later to the invention of Louis Daguerre's daguerrotype and Henry Fox Talbot's photography in the same year. <p> Batchen's history lesson is filled with eccentric characters and fascinating insights into passions and obsessions of the Age of Enlightenment. The book becomes controversial, however, in Batchen's assertion that the early photographers, rather than trying to capture reality, were, in fact, attempting to decontruct it--long before Jacques Derrida created the theory of deconstruction. Whether or not you end up agreeing with Batchen, <i>Burning with Desire</i> is a unique look at photography's roots, one sure to engender heated discussion among enthusiasts of the art form.</p>Geoffrey Batchen is Associate Professor in the Department of Art and Art History at the University of New Mexico.</p><h2>Practical English, Book 2, 2nd Edition (Harcourt Brace Jovanovich&#39;s Practical English Series)</h2><p>This enjoyable three-level series provides a solid grounding in the structures and communicative functions of English, as well as extensive practice in speaking, listening, reading, and writing.</p><p></p><h2>Renaissance Essays</h2><p>Hugh Trevor-Roper's historical essays, published over many years in many different forms, are now difficult to find. This volume gathers together pieces on British and European history from the fifteenth to the early seventeenth centuries, ending with the Thirty Years War, which Trevor-Roper views as the great historical and intellectual watershed that marked the end of the Renaissance.<br><br>Covering a wide range of topics, these writings reflect the many facets of Trevor-Roper's interest in intellectual and cultural history. Included are discussions of Renaissance Venice; the arts as patronized by that "universal man," the Emperor Maximilian I; the court of Henry VIII and the ideas of Sir Thomas More; the Lisle Letters and the formidable Cromwellian revolution; the historiography and the historical philosophy of the Elizabethans John Stow and William Camden; religion and the "judicious Hooker," the great doctor of the Anglican Church; medicine and medical philosophy, shaken out of its orthodoxy by Paracelsus and his disciples; literature and Burton's <i>Anatomy of Melancholy</i>; and the ideology of the Renaissance courts.<br><br>Trevor-Roper sets his intellectual and cultural history in a context of society and politics: in realization of ideas, the patronage of the arts, the interpretation of history, the social challenge of science, the social application of religion. This volume of essays confirms his reputation as a spectacular writer of history and master essayist.</p><p><b>Hugh Trevor-Roper</b> (1914-2003) was an English historian of early modern Britain and Nazi Germany and Regius Professor of Modern History at Oxford.

She contends that, like archaeologists of the soul, we need to excavate our hidden depths to unearth the shards of the spirit, and then reassemble those fragments into a whole self. Now, in her Journal of Inner Dialogue, Caroline offers you the perfect tool with which to keep track of the answers to those questions. It allows you to return to and examine your original answers, learn from them, and then move on to uncover the next layer of truth. The journal is conveniently divided into sections devoted to Caroline&#39;s most popular concepts: Sacred Contracts, Archetypes, and the Chakras. Brief introductions explain each concept and then give you specially prepared forms on which to record information about the people with whom you have Contracts; to answer questions to determine your 12 archetypes and help you learn more about the function of the 7 chakras; and blank Archetypal Wheels on which to cast your charts. The journal is the ideal way to work with any of Caroline&#39;s books, tapes, or workshops.</p><p>Caroline Myss is a pioneer in the field of energy medicine and human consciousness.

Opponents claim it&#x2019;s dangerous, addictive, carcinogenic, and a gateway to serious drug abuse. Fans claim it as a wonder drug, treating&nbsp;cancer, anorexia, AIDS, chronic pain, glaucoma, arthritis, migraines, PTSD, and insomnia. Patients suffering from these conditions need&#x2014;and deserve&#x2014;hard facts based on medical evidence, not hysteria and superstition.<br><br>In <i>Stoned</i>, palliative care physician Dr. David Casarett sets out to do anything&#x2014;including experimenting on himself&#x2014;to find evidence of marijuana&#x2019;s medical potential. He smears mysterious marijuana paste on his legs and samples pot wine. He poses as a patient at a seedy California clinic and takes lessons from an artisanal hash maker. In conversations with researchers, doctors, and patients around the world he learns how marijuana works&#x2014;and doesn&#x2019;t&#x2014;in the real world.<br><br>Dr. Casarett unearths tales of near-miraculous success, such as a child with chronic seizures who finally found relief in cannabidiol oil. In Tel Aviv, he learns of a nursing home that&#x2019;s found success giving marijuana to dementia patients. On the other hand, one patient who believed marijuana cured her lung cancer has clearly been misled. As Casarett sifts the myth and misinformation from the scientific&nbsp;evidence, he explains, among other things:<br><br>� Why marijuana might be the best treatment option for some types of pain<br>�&nbsp;Why there&#x2019;s no significant risk of lung damage from smoking pot<br>�&nbsp;Why most marijuana-infused beer or wine won&#x2019;t get you high<br><br>Often humorous, occasionally heartbreaking, and full of counterintuitive conclusions, Stoned offers a compassionate and much-needed medical practitioner&#x2019;s perspective on the potential of this misunderstood plant.</p><p><b>DAVID CASARETT, M.D.</b>, the author of <i>Shocked</i>, is a physician, researcher, and tenured professor at the University of Pennsylvania's Perelman School of Medicine.

Like old luggage, its tan exterior is scuffed and faded and marred by countless dents. In the gusty wind blowing across the surrounding field on the outskirts of Denver, its frame rocks restlessly on bald tires, making it seem alive. The windows are obscured by curtains. A poster on the door shows the outline of a human-shaped shooting target, pocked with bullet holes. The caption below it reads &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing in here worth dying for.&#x201d;</p><p>I turn to the man standing next to me. Nathan Pollack is in his seventies, with snow-white hair and a whorled white beard that ends in a sharp point at his chin. His black beret and rumpled tweed sport coat make him look like he could be a professor at a small liberal arts college. He is in fact a hospice doctor, like me, and he&#x2019;s about to introduce me to a patient whose story I very much want to hear.</p><p>I knock, and the door opens a few inches, revealing the head of an enormous dog with bulbous eyes and small, clipped ears. His intimidation potential is elevated a bit by the fact that his teeth are at the level of my throat.</p><p>It turns out that the dog&#x2014;all eighty pounds of him&#x2014;just wants someone to scratch behind his ears. Still, I let Pollack go in first.</p><p>Inside, the mobile home smells of stale marijuana smoke, dog, old socks, and compost. The interior is dark despite the bright winter day outside. Several heavy quilts cover the windows as insulation against the biting wind, and another covers the doorway that leads to the cab in front. The cozy womblike space is crammed with a bed, two small chairs, and a tiny kitchen area. There&#x2019;s faded wallpaper and a mock-Tudor ceiling constructed of stucco interspersed with faux wood beams. It&#x2019;s oddly homey.</p><p>As my eyes adjust to the dark, I get a good look at the man Pollack has brought me to meet. Caleb* is in his forties, lean and wiry. His neatly trimmed mustache is at odds with brown hair that&#x2019;s long and boyishly unkempt. He&#x2019;s sitting cross-legged on his bed, warmly dressed in a thermal long-sleeved shirt, a flannel shirt, jeans, and well-worn athletic socks.</p><p>Caleb&#x2019;s hands are shaking, and I recognize the resting tremor of Parkinson&#x2019;s disease. He tells me that he got that diagnosis several years ago and thinks the unusually early onset is probably a result of his work as a blacksmith and a welder. &#x201c;You inhale every heavy metal known to man,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;No surprise that they do all kinds of damage to your brain.&#x201d;</p><p>I ask him his dog&#x2019;s name, and Caleb&#x2019;s face contorts into what might pass for a smile.</p><p>&#x201c;Rocky.&#x201d;</p><p>Of course. What else would you call a boxer? I laugh, and Caleb does, too. He clutches his left side in obvious pain. Then that passes, and he starts to tell me the story I came to hear.</p><p>Two years ago, he was diagnosed with rectal cancer. He received what he described as &#x201c;aggressive&#x201d; treatment in Wisconsin. &#x201c;Some days I didn&#x2019;t think I could take any more,&#x201d; he says. &#x201c;But then I&#x2019;d go by the children&#x2019;s hospital and I&#x2019;d watch those kids playing outside and I&#x2019;d think, &#x2018;If they can handle this, then I can, too.&#x2019;&#x201d;</p><p>His doctors told him that treatment could prolong his life, but wouldn&#x2019;t cure him. So he suffered through as much treatment as he could stand, and then he drove west to Colorado where he knew he&#x2019;d be able to get marijuana legally to treat his pain and control his nausea.</p><p>Along the way, he also discovered that marijuana didn&#x2019;t only relieve those symptoms.</p><p>&#x201c;It also keeps me from being an asshole.&#x201d; He pauses. &#x201c;Well, too much of an asshole, anyway. It sort of blunts the sharp edges. I&#x2019;m not so pissed off all the time about everything&#x2014;at everyone.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Having cancer sucks,&#x201d; he admits. &#x201c;But when you&#x2019;ve got your red card&#x201d;&#x2014;that&#x2019;s Colorado&#x2019;s medical marijuana card&#x2014;&#x201c;dying sucks a little less.&#x201d;</p><p>It turned out, however, that getting marijuana wasn&#x2019;t so easy.</p><p>As soon as he parked his mobile home in this suburb outside of Denver, Caleb found Pollack&#x2019;s hospice, which promised free marijuana to its patients. That&#x2019;s essential, because Caleb lives on about $600 a month. But Pollack&#x2019;s hospice had stopped providing marijuana because the management didn&#x2019;t want to run afoul of federal laws that still classify marijuana as an illegal substance. So once he was in Denver, Caleb wasn&#x2019;t able to get marijuana from Pollack&#x2019;s hospice, and he couldn&#x2019;t afford to buy his own.</p><p>As Caleb tells his story, he drops the courtly politeness with which he&#x2019;d greeted me a few minutes ago, and his language becomes increasingly laced with profanity. He goes on to say how much he depends on the marijuana he smokes. But he can&#x2019;t afford it.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, there&#x2019;s plenty of places to buy. That&#x2019;s the hell of it. Sure it&#x2019;s legal, but&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; He rubs his thumb and forefinger together in the universal sign for money. &#x201c;You have to be able to pay.&#x201d;</p><p>I ask him if he&#x2019;d found another hospice that could give him marijuana, and he grins.</p><p>&#x201c;No, I didn&#x2019;t really look.&#x201d; He winks at Pollack. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll complain, sure. I&#x2019;m not shy. Especially when I&#x2019;m pissed off. But these are good folks. They take good care of me.&#x201d;</p><p>He&#x2019;s stayed with Pollack&#x2019;s hospice, and he&#x2019;s gotten marijuana from so-called angels in the community who make donations directly to him. That keeps the hospice out of trouble, which is fine with Caleb.</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t want anybody going to jail for me.&#x201d;</p><p>Besides, he has a plan.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m growing my own. See?&#x201d; He points.</p><p>To my left, at the rear of the mobile home, there&#x2019;s a grow light suspended over a plastic tub. The light sways gently in the wind, casting undulating shadows of what looks like about thirty immature marijuana plants. A few are about eighteen inches tall and look like they might start budding in a couple of weeks. But most are no more than a couple of inches high.</p><p>Caleb admits that those smaller plants were the result of an accident. Literally. He went to pick up plants from someone who was moving and wanted to give them a good home. But problems ensued.</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not the best driver, you know?&#x201d;</p><p>I look back at the psychoactive garden. I nod.</p><p>Caleb is a little vague about details, but apparently while he was driving, the microwave fell off its shelf and several plants lost their lives. He salvaged what he could by taking cuttings and creating clones, which are the Lilliputian plants that take up most of his little greenhouse.</p><p>I notice a box on a shelf behind him. It&#x2019;s labeled COMFORT KIT.</p><p>This is a set of medications that many hospices provide to their patients in case of emergencies. It generally includes morphine for pain, and benzodiazepines like Valium for anxiety and seizures.</p><p>Has he used them?</p><p>&#x201c;Hell no. They don&#x2019;t work. Why would I waste my time with them?&#x201d; He gestures at a dime bag of marijuana on the kitchen counter. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s all I need, right there.&#x201d;</p><p>Caleb recognizes the irony of this arrangement. His hospice can provide a variety of drugs such as morphine free of charge. These are drugs that have the potential to cause a fatal overdose, and which can be addictive. But the drug that really helps him&#x2014;marijuana&#x2014;is out of reach.</p><p>&#x201c;Those are your tax dollars at work, man. You&#x2019;re paying for the government to spend money on that box of shitty drugs that I&#x2019;m not going to touch. That&#x2019;s a waste. But what I really need, they can&#x2019;t give me. Does that make sense?&#x201d;</p><p>I admit that it doesn&#x2019;t. As if in agreement, Rocky the boxer hops off the bed where he&#x2019;d been sitting with Caleb and rests his chin on my leg.</p><p>Does Medical Marijuana &#x201c;Work&#x201d;?</p><p>In Pollack&#x2019;s Toyota, heading back to Denver, I think about Caleb&#x2019;s predicament. I&#x2019;m a little shell-shocked by what I&#x2019;ve heard. I&#x2019;d always thought of medical marijuana as a joke. Or a &#x201c;treatment&#x201d; that would always be described in just that way, hemmed in by ironic quotes.</p><p>Yet Caleb is dying and in pain. And he wants it&#x2014;needs it&#x2014;for relief. This isn&#x2019;t a guy who wants to get high for fun. This is a man who has led a hard life and who doesn&#x2019;t want to suffer more than he has to.</p><p>Some patients I&#x2019;ve taken care of in my work as a hospice and palliative care doctor have admitted to me that they use marijuana for symptoms like pain or nausea. (And I&#x2019;m pretty sure that for every patient who has been honest with me about using marijuana, there are many more who haven&#x2019;t.) They&#x2019;ve made it into a joke, just as I have.</p><p>Laughing uncomfortably, one Vietnam veteran told me he started smoking half a joint per day more than twenty years ago to control his PTSD symptoms. Better to be high than out of his head, right? I laughed, too, and we moved on to talk about his cancer pain that I was treating.</p><p>I&#x2019;m pretty sure I shouldn&#x2019;t have laughed. Like Caleb, that veteran needed help. He&#x2019;d found something that relieved his symptoms, and he needed my support.</p><p>I don&#x2019;t remember what I said. Probably some version of what all doctors say when confronted with alternative medicine we don&#x2019;t understand (or, in the case of marijuana, common but usually illegal). &#x201c;Well, I guess it can&#x2019;t hurt.&#x201d; Or, &#x201c;If it makes you feel better&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; But I didn&#x2019;t ask him whether it helped him, or how.</p><p>Marijuana is the <i>only</i> thing that&#x2019;s helped Caleb. This is a guy who is letting $100 worth of morphine and other interesting drugs sit in his closet. He&#x2019;d rather have a joint.</p><p>What&#x2019;s more, Caleb turned to marijuana to avoid drugs like morphine. Not only is he convinced that marijuana is helpful, he&#x2019;s convinced that it&#x2019;s better than the legal drugs he can get for free. It might be safer, too.</p><p>&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;�&nbsp;</p><p>Does marijuana &#x201c;work&#x201d;?</p><p>When I met Caleb in early 2014, the debate about legalizing medical marijuana was just beginning to get national attention. But that debate was about ethics and morality. Do people have a right to use it? And how should laws be crafted?</p><p>No one was really talking seriously about whether marijuana has any medical value. Or whether it&#x2019;s safe. Or, setting the bar a little lower, whether it&#x2019;s at least as safe as other drugs that doctors prescribe.</p><p>My goal with this book is to shift the national discussion, and to bring these questions about effectiveness and safety to the forefront. These are the questions we really need to be asking. And these are the questions that I wanted to be able to answer in order to decide, as a physician, what advice I should give my patients when they ask me whether they should use medical marijuana.</p><p>In this book I&#x2019;ve attempted to look carefully&#x2014;and critically&#x2014;at the evidence. I searched for high-quality published studies, and I interviewed researchers who are doing those studies. In short, I subjected medical marijuana to the same scrutiny that I&#x2019;d give to the drugs that the pharmaceutical industry tries to sell to physicians like me.</p><p>First, I investigated whether marijuana works as medicine. I scoured medical journals, interviewed patients, and visited physicians and researchers. I wanted to find out what we know about marijuana&#x2019;s effect on conditions related to the brain, such as insomnia and PTSD and seizures. I wanted to learn whether it could be useful in treating physical symptoms such as nausea and weight loss, and whether the ingredients in marijuana might actually treat diseases like dementia, multiple sclerosis, or cancer.</p><p>Then I explored how people get marijuana into their systems. That might seem like a silly question, but it&#x2019;s not an easy one to answer. I learned how to infuse the ingredients of marijuana into beer and wine and brownies and ointment. I discovered how effective joints and bongs are at delivering marijuana&#x2019;s ingredients to our brains compared to newer technologies such as vaporizers. Along the way, I learned how to make hash. I even discovered what I&#x2019;ve been told is the world&#x2019;s best pot brownie recipe. (Here, in case you want to skip ahead.)</p><p>All that is great, but is marijuana <i>safe</i>? For most readers of this book, this might be the most important question. So I sifted through the evidence about whether long-term use causes brain damage, or mental illness, or addiction. I discovered there are other risks of marijuana use beyond its effects on the brain&#x2014;from infertility to shrinking penises and everything in between. I&#x2019;ll also share my own misguided experiences with medical marijuana, and I&#x2019;ll take you for a drive with one of my patients shortly after he smoked a joint.</p><p>Next, how are patients like Caleb figuring out whether marijuana could help them? How do they sort through the risks and potential benefits of this stuff? Where do they turn for advice? And how reliable is that advice?</p><p>Finally, what does the future hold for medical marijuana? Is it on its way to being the next superdrug? Should it be legalized and made more available? Or is this all merely hype to justify recreational drug use?</p><p>These are high-stakes questions. As of this writing, twenty-three states and the District of Columbia have legalized marijuana for medical purposes, and a few have allowed it for recreational purposes, too. It seems very likely that medical marijuana will be legal in most states in the not-too-distant future. And in states where it&#x2019;s legal, lots of people are using it. According to one study in California, 5 percent of people surveyed had used medical marijuana.1 That means that my questions about marijuana&#x2019;s effectiveness, and especially its safety, have big implications for hundreds of thousands of people.</p><p>These numbers are likely to increase further as more dispensaries open to sell marijuana. That was the conclusion of another study in California that surveyed more than eight thousand people in fifty cities and mapped their proximity to marijuana dispensaries. The results: people who were close to a dispensary used more marijuana.2</p><p>The states that have legalized it have done so with very broad criteria. You can use it for chronic pain, anxiety, insomnia, arthritis, and a wide variety of other conditions. Most people who are embracing it are not near the end of life. They are students, construction workers, police officers, teachers, and&#x2014;I can attest&#x2014;at least one doctor.</p><p>If medical marijuana works, then its growing popularity is good news. But if it doesn&#x2019;t work, then it&#x2019;s an enormous waste of time and money. Even worse, if marijuana isn&#x2019;t safe, we&#x2019;ll have an enormous public health crisis on our hands. As you&#x2019;ll see later in the book, if lots of people are using medical marijuana, even a very small risk could result in lots of people being harmed or even killed.</p><p>As I started writing this book, the public was just beginning to recognize those risks. For instance, one study found that long-term marijuana use was associated with brain atrophy&#x2014;in other words, brain shrinkage.3 But shortly after that rather alarming study made headlines, <i>The New York Times</i> published an editorial in favor of legalizing medical marijuana, and discounting its risks. So is it safe or not?4</p><p>Whether marijuana is safe and effective is particularly important because its safety will determine how it&#x2019;s regulated.

He shows how the 1920s witnessed renewed hope and a flourishing of modernist art and literature, but how the decade ended in economic collapse and gave rise to a second, more devastating world war and genocide on an unprecedented scale. Jarausch further explores how Western Europe surprisingly recovered due to American help and political integration. Finally, he examines how the Cold War pushed the divided continent to the brink of nuclear annihilation, and how the unforeseen triumph of liberal capitalism came to be threatened by Islamic fundamentalism, global economic crisis, and an uncertain future.</p><p>A stunning achievement, <i>Out of Ashes</i> explores the paradox of the European encounter with modernity in the twentieth century, shedding new light on why it led to cataclysm, inhumanity, and self-destruction, but also social justice, democracy, and peace.</p></p><p><p>"<i>Out of Ashes</i> is the magnum opus of an outstanding scholar.

He makes the study of European history an intellectual adventure again."<b>--J�rgen Kocka, Free University of Berlin</b></p><p>"Europe's Faustian bargain is the subject of Konrad Jarausch's authoritative new history of Europe. This is a history of the groundswell of material progress--from science and technology to production and consumption--and the inability to master it. The failure to meet these challenges spiraled into a devastating politics of destruction in the First and Second World Wars that was stopped only at the cost of a Cold War. Would the collapse of 1989 jump-start a new and more modest European order in a global world? <i>Out of Ashes</i> points to the lessons learned as well as to the current predicaments Europe faces."<b>--Michael Geyer, University of Chicago</b></p><p>"This is a well-written, well-organized, and detailed study of a notoriously difficult subject: Europe in the twentieth century.

Mount Misery is a prestigious facility set in the rolling green hills of New England, its country club atmosphere maintained by generous corporate contributions. Dr. Roy Basch (hero of The House of God) is lucky enough to train there *only to discover doctors caught up in the circus of competing psychiatric theories, and patients who are often there for one main reason: they've got good insurance.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>Your colleagues will hurt you more than your patients.<br><br>On rounds at Mount Misery, it's not always easy for Basch to tell the patients from the doctors: Errol Cabot, the drug cowboy whose practice provides him with guinea pigs for his imaginative prescription cocktails . . . Blair Heiler, the world expert on borderlines (a diagnosis that applies to just about everybody) . . . A. K. Lowell, n�e Aliyah K. Lowenschteiner, whose Freudian analytic technique is so razor sharp it prohibits her from actually speaking to patients . . . And Schlomo Dove, the loony, outlandish shrink accused of having sex with a beautiful, well-to-do female patient.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>Psychiatrists specialize in their defects. <br><br>For Basch the practice of psychiatry soon becomes a nightmare in which psychiatrists compete with one another to find the best ways to reduce human beings to blubbering drug-addled pods, or incite them to an extreme where excessive rage is the only rational response, or tie them up in Freudian knots. And all the while, the doctors seem less interested in their patients' mental health than in a host of other things *managed care insurance money, drug company research grants and kickbacks, and their own professional advancement.<br>From the Laws of Mount Misery:<br><br>In psychiatry, first comes treatment, then comes diagnosis.<br><br>What The House of God did for doctoring the body, Mount Misery does for doctoring the mind. A practicing psychiatrist, Samuel Shem brings vivid authenticity and extraordinary storytelling gifts to this long-awaited sequel, to create a novel that is laugh-out-loud hilarious, terrifying, and provocative. Filled with biting irony and a wonderful sense of the absurd, Mount Misery tells you everything you'll never learn in therapy. And it's a hell of a lot funnier.</p><p>Anyone who has read Samuel Shem's previous novel, <i>The House of God</i>, will be familiar with Dr. Roy Basch, the protagonist of <i>Mount Misery</i>. When last seen, Dr. Basch was completing a grueling residency; <i>Mount Misery</i> finds him beginning his psychiatric training at an upscale New England mental hospital. His introduction to the myriad forms of therapy available today--everything from Freudian psychoanalysis to psychopharmacology--provides Mr. Shem with plenty of blackly humorous grist for his mill. In this hospital, apparently, you need a score card to tell the doctors from the patients. <p> Shem (the pseudonym of psychiatrist and playwright Dr. Stephen Bergman) delights in broad parody. He creates, for example, characters such as Dr. Heiler who gives lectures entitled "Borderline Germans and German Borderlines," or Dr. A. K. Lowell, whose devotion to Freudian analysis is so extreme that she refuses to speak to patients at all. Though the humor can be clumsy at times, Shem makes some serious points about the perils of psychotherapy in which the therapist is not above reproach.</p>"MOUNT MISERY is outrageously funny, a sage and important novel by a healer and a Shakespearean." <br>--The Boston Globe <br> <br>"AN ENGROSSING READ . . .

He shows that this poem, aimed at promoting spiritual tranquillity, confronts two anxieties about death not addressed in Epicurus's abstract treatment--the fear of the process of dying and the fear of nothingness. Lucretius, Segal argues, deals more specifically with the body in dying because he draws on the Roman concern with corporeality as well as on the rich traditions of epic and tragic poetry on mortality.</p><p>Segal explains how Lucretius's sensitivity to the vulnerability of the body's boundaries connects the deaths of individuals with the deaths of worlds, thereby placing human death into the poem's larger context of creative and destructive energies in the universe. The controversial ending of the poem, which describes the plague at Athens, is thus the natural culmination of a theme developed over the course of the work.</p><p>Originally published in 1990.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Organized into three categories--``Farmers,'' ``Workers,'' ``Domestic Servants''- -the letters selected were written by 20 different individuals or families, each contributing several letters over a course of years. The correspondents offer an intimate look at immigrant triumphs and troubles (most often about money, especially falling into debt, or about bad health: as Christian Lenz writes in 1849 from Tennessee to his brother in Germany, ``here there's no fear of war, what the sword is for you is here the Korlra [cholera]...Here the sickness is so common that in the big cities half the people have been buried'')--as well as fresh eyewitness descriptions of America (``Dear Marie,'' writes Wilhelmine Wiebusch in 1884 from Brooklyn to her overseas mother, ``you really ought to see New York...the most beautiful and main street, Broadway, is more than 6 hours long...Crossing the street is positively dangerous, one wagon after the next, so loud you can't hear yourself talk, business and money everywhere'').

It provides a continuous commentary on all other Greek arts, even sculpture, and the scenes figured on the vases can prove to be as subtle and informative as the works of Greek literature. In no other art of antiquity do we come closer to the visual experience of the ancient Greeks or share their views on life, myth, and even politics. The stylistic history of Greek vases has been demonstrated in other Thames &amp; Hudson books by John Boardman. Here he sketches that history but goes on to explore the many other matters that make the study so fruitful. He describes the methods of making and decorating vases, the processes of identifying the artists, life in the potters' quarter in Greek towns, the way in which the wares were traded far beyond the borders of the Greek world, from Morocco to Persia, from Russia to the Sudan, and problems in making and decorating them. He shows how Greek artists exercised a style of narrative in art that was long influential in the West, and how their pictures reflected not simply on storytelling but on the politics and social order of the day. The vases' function in Greek culture and as messengers of style and subject are explained.</p><p><b>John Boardman</b>, Lincoln Professor Emeritus of Classical Archaeology and Art at Oxford University, has written widely on the arts of ancient Greece.Sir John Boardman author of Greek Art, Athenian Black Figure Vases and Early Greek Vase Painting is Mr. Greek Vases, and his masterful and classy explications of what might in other hands seem dry and dusty archeological material are a joy to read. Here Boardman gets down to the nitty-gritty of how and why potters created and decorated the vases, how their artistic quality developed and their influence spread. "The raw material could not be commoner or cheaper," he points out, yet Greek vases still astonish with their ornate elegance. Perhaps most illuminating here, along with the 358 clear and well-placed b&amp;w photo illustrations, are short chapters devoted to aspects of painting and to techniques used to create the vases throwing different pieces on the potter's wheel and then joining them later, as opposed to trying to create them all of a piece. Tricks for studying vases are also included: one amusing example takes note of a vase that can be roughly dated because the names of its young lad models, some of whom grew up to be well-known citizens, are listed on it. ("They were only of interest to their aged fondlers while they were still boys," notes Boardman.) A wise scholar, Boardman concludes with remarks on common sense, itself everywhere evident in this book: "It remains essential in the formulation and execution of any academic exercise and is itself largely the product of experience, though we should take nothing for granted." No one even vaguely interested in ancient art will take this distillation of more than 50 years of study and scholarship for granted. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>The Lewis and Clark Expedition: Selections from the Journals, Arranged by Topic (The Bedford Series in History and Culture)</h2><p>This is the story of a two-year journey in the time of President Thomas Jefferson along the Missouri and Columbia rivers, and over the Rocky Mountains, in search of a navigable waterway to the Pacific Ocean.

His overview of Native American cultures at the turn of the eighteenth century is one of the most impressively even handed treatments of this topic that I have seen.&#34;</p><h2>Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours (Sams Teach Yourself in 24 Hours)</h2><p><p> <b>Learn HTML5 and CSS3 in 24 one-hour lessons!</b> <br> <br> <i>Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours</i> is a well-organized, clearly written, and generously illustrated tutorial that teaches beginners how to quickly create great-looking web pages using HTML5 and CSS3.<br> <br>With a practical, jargon-free focus on quickly getting web pages created and published to the web, the book's 24 one-hour lessons carefully guide the reader through each step involved in creating, enhancing, and maintaining web sites of all types and sizes. <br> <br>The ninth edition of <i>Sams Teach Yourself HTML and CSS in 24 Hours</i> brings the entire book in line with the HTML5 and CSS3 specifications and capabilities and includes fresh material and examples that take full advantage of the book's full-color layout and design.<br> <br>Anyone who completes the lessons in this book can have his or her web pages be among those that appear on the Internet.

There are 13 sessions, each providing 3 hours of practical work and problems. The problems are well-illustrated with photographs and drawings, and the solutions are discussed in detail. All the sessions are drawn from actual geological examples and are extensively illustrated with photographs taken in the field and with micrographs, giving students a feeling for what actually occurs in nature.</p><p>Volume 2 contains 13 sessions comprising practical work and problems. The approach is to help the student develop his own methods and to solve problems by logical thinking, rather than to rely on the routine application of a previously described and well-worn &#39;magic&#39; formula. Each session starts with the formulation of a problem and the presentation of any essential background or necessary mathematical techniques. All the sessions are drawn from actual geological examples and are extensively illustrated with photographs taken in the field and with micrographs, giving the students a feeling for what occurs in nature. The problems are also well illustrated with photographs and drawings, and the solutions draw out the key features of the methods used." Impressive features of this book are its thoughtful and meticulous compilation, the effort to use real rather than artificial examples where possible, the clarity and beauty of the plates, and the generally high standard of production. Ramsay and Huber's book deserves to be widely used."<br>--Geological Magazine<br>"The book should become a basic reference for all structural geologists, especially the specialist in small-scale structures. &nbsp;It could be used by graduate students or, perhaps, by well prepared senior undergraduates."<br>--Tectonophysics<br>"It is clear from volume 2 that this series will be the best ever produced teaching text in geology. The authors and publishers are to be congratulated. &nbsp;Although several references are made to volume 1 on Strain Analysis, volume 2 stands alone and should be in great demand, not only by advanced students, but by any practicing geologist needing an update on structural geology. The problems.....give students a feel for the excitement of ongoing research. &nbsp;The sessions conclude with the best review of joints I have ever read. &nbsp;For good measure , appendices give a concise outline of force and stress and an excellent minature on geological mapping. &nbsp;&nbsp;The illustrations and diagrams are superb throughout and in themselves constitute a valuable "atlas" of deformation structures. &nbsp;Those who struggle with mathematics have little to fear, because rigorous treatment of mechanisms have been reserved for volume 3. &nbsp;In conclusion, if you're a structural expert, student, or just want to know what the deformation boys are up to, rush out and buy this book, it is excellent value."<br>--Earth Science Reviews, 1989<br>"Like the first volume, this one is copiously and beautifully illustrated. &nbsp;The line drawings , as one has come to expect, are excellent and almost all drawn just for this book. &nbsp;Nearly all the photographs are previously unpublished, and they are very good indeed. A strength is the reliance on natural examples to illustrate the principles and techniques described, in contrast to many other practical books of structural geology. &nbsp;Every topic is illustrated with at least one natural example, giving the book a firm basis in "groundtruth". &nbsp;The authors state clearly the assumptions of the methods they use and discuss what the sources of error are, and they stress the need for caution in applying them and interpreting the results. &nbsp;... &nbsp;There is no question that the series of which this volume is a part will have a significant impact on the teaching and practice of structural geology. &nbsp;One of the great virtues of the book is that it engages the reader in the subject matter, forces him or her to think about it by posing basic questions about the form and origin of structures, and then leads him or her through answers which, in many cases, leader to the reader posing further questions; &nbsp;That is exactly what a good text book should do."&nbsp;<br>--Episodes, 1988<br>"The book should be ideal for students who want to learn techniques of structural geology by themselves or for teachers who are too busy or too lazy to put together practical exercises. The illustrations are mostly new and are excellent. The first four sessions deal with geometric aspects of folds. &nbsp;The approach is delightfully practical and simple, with the lack of pretentiousness that seems to mark John Ramsay's style. &nbsp;The sessions on faults is novel in some respects dealing with the basics in a very practical way. &nbsp;The session on the mechanical analysis of fractures goes through the usual analyses of stress, simple elasticity, failure criteria and Mohr envelopes, but does so in a refreshingly simple way, uncluttered with excess mathematics. &nbsp;There are also pleasing digressions into such subjects as fault-plane solutions, shatter cones and vein formation. &nbsp;Amongst the appendices, the one on stress is straightforward, but the one on geological mapping contains many useful hints and two examples of John Ramsay's field maps which set remarkably high standards (the originals will probably become collector's items). &nbsp;This book is very good in terms of illustrations, simple mathematical exercises, kinematics of folds and fault patterns, and practical hints for the field geologist."<br>--Journal of Structural Geology, 1988<br>"Like the first volume, which dealt with analyses of largly homogeneous strains and the resulting rock fabrics, the second is a manual largely to be worked at rather than read.

Polak shows that programs based on these ideas have utterly failed&#x2014;in fact, in sub-Saharan Africa poverty rates have actually gone up.<br> These failed top-down efforts contrast sharply with the grassroots approach Polak and IDE have championed: helping the dollar-a-day poor earn more money through their own efforts. Amazingly enough, unexploited market opportunities do exist for the desperately poor. Polak describes how he and others have identified these opportunities and have developed innovative, low-cost tools that have helped impoverished rural farmers use the market to improve their lives.<br> Throughout the book Polak tells fascinating and moving stories about the people he and IDE have helped, especially Krishna Bahadur Thapa, a Nepali farmer who went from barely surviving to earning $4,800 a year&#x2014;solidly upper middle class by local standards. Out of Poverty offers a new and promising way to end world poverty, one that honors the entrepreneurial spirit of the poor themselves.</p><p><b>Preface</b> <p>My fifteen-month-old grandson, Ethan, has fallen in love with a neighbor's driveway. It sits two houses down from where he lives in Sebastopol, California, and it seems to overflow with small, multi - colored stones. He stops there when I take him for a walk, and then he refuses to leave. He picks up a handful of stones and inspects each one carefully. He places them one after another in my hand, watching intently, and I give them back to him one by one until his hand is full again. I don't know who has given him the job of turning every little stone over and over in his hand until he understands its very essence, but that's the job he has accepted, and he's not leaving until it's done. He plops down on his butt and cuffs the stones into a pile, looks at me, and knocks it down and giggles. He can keep this up for hours, and if I pick him up to take him home, he cries. His playful curiosity is infectious, and I think I must have inherited a lot of genes from Ethan, because I operate just as he does. I live to play and to satisfy my curiosity.</p> <p>For the past twenty-five years, two questions have kept my curiosity aroused: What makes poor people poor? And what can they do about their poverty?</p> <p>Because of these infernal questions, I've dozed off during hundreds of long jeep rides with good companions over dusty, potholed roads. I've had thousands of conversations with one-acre farmers with dirt on their hands. We've walked along their patches of ten-foot-high black pepper vines in the central hills of Vietnam beside jungle permanently scarred by Agent Orange. We've strolled together through their scattered quarter-acre plots in the drab brown winter plains of the Gangetic delta in Uttar Pradesh, and they have offered me more cups of steaming tea than my seventy-three-year-old kidneys can take. I love discovering new things from people nobody else ever seems to listen to, and I love talking them into trying out some of the crazy ideas that we come up with together. I have learned more from talking with these poor farmers than from any other thing I have done in my life.</p> <p>This book will tell their story and describe some of the things these people have taught me. It will tell the story of Krishna Bahadur Thapa and his family, and of how they moved from barely surviving on less than a dollar a day to earning forty-eight hundred dollars a year from their two-acre farm in the hills of Nepal. I tell many stories like Baha - dur's in this book, and I hope that each one of them satisfies another small bit of your curiosity about how people who are extremely poor live their lives and dream their dreams. Best of all, what I learned from these people has been put to work in straightforward strategies that millions of other poor people have used to end their poverty forever. </p><p>Each of the practical solutions to poverty I describe is obvious and direct. For example, since 800 million of the people whose families survive on less than a dollar a day earn their living from small farms, why not start by looking for ways they can make more money from farming? And since these farmers work for less than a dollar a day, why not look for ways they can take advantage of their remarkably low labor rates by growing high-value, labor-intensive cash crops and selling them at the time of year when these crops will fetch the highest prices? If it is true that common sense is not really common, and that seeing and doing the obvious are even less so, then some of the conclusions I draw from my conversations with poor people will surprise you: they certainly fly in the face of conventional theory and practice in the development field.</p> <p>I hate books about poverty that make you feel guilty, as well as dry, academic ones that put you to sleep. Working to alleviate poverty is a lively, exciting field capable of generating new hope and inspiration, not feelings of gloom and doom. Learning the truth about poverty generates disruptive innovations capable of enriching the lives of rich people even more than those of poor people.</p> <p>The first section of the book explains how I became curious about poverty, describes the process I learned for finding creative solutions to just about any major social problem, and challenges the three great poverty eradication myths that have inhibited doing the obvious to end poverty.</p> <p>The next section, Chapters 3 to 8, describes what many small-acreage farmers have taught me, a practical approach capable of ending the poverty of some 800 million of the world's dollar-a-day people. For poor people themselves, there is little doubt that the single most important step they can take to move out of poverty is to learn how to make more money. The way to do it is through grassroots enterprises --just about all of the poor are already tough, stubborn, survival entrepreneurs--and they have to find ways to make their enterprises more profitable. For small-farm enterprises, the path to new wealth lies in growing market-centered, high-value, labor-intensive cash crops. To accomplish this, poor farmers need access to affordable irrigation, a new generation of farming methods and inputs customized to fit tiny farms, the creation of vibrant new markets that bring them the seeds and fertilizers they need, and open access to markets where smallacreage farmers can sell their products at a profit. This range of new products and services for poor customers can only be created by a revolution in current design practice, based on the ruthless pursuit of affordability. Chapter 9 describes how the principles discussed in the earlier chapters can be applied to helping poor people living in urban slums and on the sidewalks of cities in developing countries.</p> <p>In the wrap-up section, Chapter 10 describes the central role poverty plays in most of the problems facing planet Earth; Chapter 11 describes what donors, governments, universities, research institutions, and the rest of us can do to end poverty; and Chapter 12 tells how Bahadur and his family finally moved out of poverty.</p> <p>My hope is that you will come away from reading this book energized and inspired. There is much to be done.</p><p>A Proven Solution to World Poverty</p> <p>Why are so many millions of people around the world still mired in poverty, despite decades of relief efforts? International Development Enterprises founder Paul Polak explains that it's because most poverty eradication programs are fatally flawed. In <i>Out of Poverty</i>, Polak exposes these flaws and describes the alternate approach he and his organization have championed--an approach that has lifted millions out of poverty and given them the power to control their own destiny.</p> <p><b>Endorsements</b></p> <p>"<i>Out of Poverty</i> teaches us to think simple.

As part of the post-Tet American counter-offensive, the 3d Marine Division was preparing to attack NVA units staging along the DMZ when, on April 29, the 320th NVA Division was spotted less than four miles from the Marines&#39;s Dong Ha Combat Base. Brutal fighting soon developed in nearby Dai Do as the 2d Battalion, 4th Marines, known as the &#34;Magnificent Bastards&#34;, struggled to eject NVA forces from this strategic hamlet located just two miles from the division&#39;s headquarters and main supply base. Aided by the &#34;Gimlets&#34; of the U.S. Army Americal Division&#39;s 3d Battalion, 21st Infantry, who became embroiled in a bitter battle at neighboring Nhi Ha, the &#34;Magnificent Bastards&#34; held their ground in a see-saw contest with the larger NVA force until they were relieved by the 1st Battalion, 3d Marines, on May 3. Keith Nolan&#39;s gripping account of this nightmarish struggle reminiscent of the horrific clashes along World War I&#39;s western front is sure to become a classic in the annals of Vietnam War literature.Keith Nolan is acknowledged as the foremost chronicler of the Vietnam War. He is the author of many Vietnam War combat histories, including Battle for Hue: Tet 1968; The Battle for Saigon: Tet 1968; Death Valley: The Summer Offensive, I Corps, August 1969; Ripcord: Screaming Eagles Under Siege, Vietnam 1970, and House to House: Playing the Enemy&#x2019;s Game in Saigon, May 1968.

These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals), who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest. The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.</p><p>William Shakespeare is considered by many to be the greatest playwright in the history of the English language. The bulk of Shakespeare&#x2019;s working life was spent in the theater world of London, where he established himself professionally by the early 1590s. He enjoyed success not only as a playwright and poet, but also as an actor and shareholder in an acting company. Although some think that sometime between 1610 and 1613 Shakespeare retired from the theater and returned home to Stratford, where he died in 1616, others believe that he may have continued to work in London until close to his death. Shakespeare was born in April 1564 in the town of Stratford-upon-Avon, on England&#x2019;s Avon River. When he was eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway. The couple had three children&#x2015;an older daughter Susanna and twins, Judith and Hamnet. Hamnet, Shakespeare&#x2019;s only son, died in childhood.<br><br>Crystal S.

If you&#x2019;ve ever wondered how it came into being, and what inspired its creation, Sean McManus, co-author of Raspberry Pi For Dummies, has the answer. He has set up a section on his website to share bonus content, which includes a short history of the Raspberry Pi. At Sean&#x2019;s website, you can also read reviews of the book, see videos of its projects, and read several exclusive blog posts about the Raspberry Pi and its community.</p> <p>Visit Sean&#x2019;s homepage for Raspberry Pi For Dummies here!</p></p><p><p><b>Q &amp; A with Sean McManus, author of <em>Raspberry Pi for Dummies</em></b></p> Sean McManus <strong>What was your first thought when you heard about the Raspberry Pi?</strong> <p>I felt a sense of wonder. Firstly, that the Raspberry Pi Foundation had managed to create such a powerful machine for such a cheap price. And secondly, wonder at the fantastic opportunities that it opens up for families, electronics hobbyists, and those who want to learn about technology.</p> <strong>Why do you think Raspberry Pi has become so popular so fast?</strong> <p>A lot of people have been waiting for exactly this kind of technology: something that makes programming and electronics accessible and affordable. A community has built up around the Raspberry Pi that inspires newcomers to want to get involved and learn about what they can do with the device.</p> <p>The price is a big factor, too. It means that once you've thought of something you can do with the Raspberry Pi, it's a no-brainer to buy one. Some people want to build robots with it; some want to learn programming; some just want a high-definition media centre for playing their videos and music. It's incredibly versatile.</p> <strong>What makes the Raspberry Pi a great tool for getting younger people interested in programming?</strong> <p>The Raspberry Pi comes with the Python and Scratch programming languages in the recommended software version. Scratch is highly visual and is increasingly used in schools to teach younger children. It's well suited to making simple games and animations, but encapsulates a lot of the ideas that underpin most programming languages. </p> <p>After that, young people can graduate to Python, which is more text-based. It is designed to make it easy to read program code, and it's widely used in the real world outside of education by companies including YouTube, Google, and Industrial Light &amp; Magic.</p> <p>The Raspberry Pi also makes it easy to use your programs to control your own electronic circuits, which is a lot of fun for people of all ages.</p> <strong>What is your favorite Raspberry Pi project?</strong> <p>There are so many out there in the community, that it's hard to choose. I think the one-button audiobook player Michael Clemens made for his wife's grandmother is my favourite, though. She is visually impaired and finds other audio players hard to use, so Michael made one that has just a single button to play and pause. She can hold down the button to go back one track. This is an example of the Raspberry Pi really improving the quality of someone's life. I love listening to audiobooks, so I can imagine how much this means to her.</p> <strong>Any advice for someone who just bought a Raspberry Pi and is ready to get started using it?</strong> <p>The Raspberry Pi comes as just a small circuit board and you have to connect your own keyboard, mouse and monitor. People sometimes experience problems because the keyboard and mouse they use aren't compatible with the Raspberry Pi, so it's worth doing a bit of online research to check compatibility before buying a new keyboard or mouse. I recommend keeping a stack of SD cards (clearly labeled!) so you can try out different versions of the operating system software, and keep one for Raspbmc, the media centre software. </p> <p>Learn how to discover and install new software, too. There's a huge amount of free software you can install on your Raspberry Pi, and you can really personalize it by finding exactly the right software for your needs. </p> <strong>What's something you can do with a Raspberry Pi that might surprise people?</strong> <p>Most people know you can use the Raspberry Pi for programming, electronics, or as a media centre. So ironically, the most surprising thing is perhaps the most ordinary. You can also use it for creating documents and spreadsheets, doing basic photo editing, and browsing the Internet. The Raspberry Pi is not as fast as a modern PC, but it is still a great machine for younger family members to use for creative projects and homework.</p><p>Learn to:</p> <ul> <li>Connect the Raspberry Pi and install the OS</li> <li>Get productive with word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and images</li> <li>Learn simple programming with Scratch and Python</li> <li>Create electronics projects connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO port</li> </ul> <p>Join the Raspberry Revolution and start having fun with your Raspberry Pi &#x2014; today!</p> <p>As small as a credit card and ultra-affordable, the Raspberry Pi packs plenty of power into a pocket-size computer.

The Times Literary Supplement</p><h2>The Life of the Spider</h2><p>The Spider has a bad name: to most of us, she represents an odious, noxious animal, which every one hastens to crush under foot. Against this summary verdict the observer sets the beast&#x2019;s industry, its talent as a weaver, its wiliness in the chase, its tragic nuptials and other characteristics of great interest. Yes, the Spider is well worth studying, apart from any scientific reasons; but she is said to be poisonous and that is her crime and the primary cause of the repugnance wherewith she inspires us. Poisonous, I agree, if by that we understand that the animal is armed with two fangs which cause the immediate death of the little victims which it catches; but there is a wide difference between killing a Midge and harming a man. However immediate in its effects upon the insect entangled in the fatal web, the Spider&#x2019;s poison is not serious for us and causes less inconvenience than a Gnat-bite. That, at least, is what we can safely say as regards the great majority of the Spiders of our regions.</p><p></p><h2>The Future Generation: The Zine-Book for Subculture Parents, Kids, Friends &amp; Others</h2><p>China Martens started her pioneering mamazine <i>The Future Generation</i> in 1990.

The first female painter since Artemisia Gentileschi in the seventeenth century to portray an ideal of heroic femininity, Romaine Brooks (1874-1970), like her contemporary Gwen John, shaped an image of the androgynous New Woman for the twentieth century.<br><br>An American born in Rome, Brooks spent most of her life in Paris. After a brief but passionate romance with the poet Gabriel D'Annunzio, with whom she maintained a lifelong friendship, she turned to relationships with women and to art to express her emerging self. For many years the companion of Natalie Barney, whom the artist depicted as <i>L'Amazone</i> in one of her most famous portraits, Brooks belonged to the international lesbian community that included Compton and Faith MacKenzie, Ren�e Vivien, Radclyffe Hall (who immortalized Brooks as the barely fictionalized American painter Venetia Ford in <i>The Forge</i>), and Una, Lady Troubridge.<br><br>The milieu Brooks chose was the privileged, often eccentric demi-monde of wealthy aristocrats and expatriate writers, artists, intellectuals, and performers who gathered in Rome, London, Capri, Paris, and Florence. The social circles she traveled in included Somerset Maugham, Norman Douglas, Charles Freer, Count Robert de Montesquiou, Jean Cocteau, Augustus John, Carl Van Vechten, and Ida Rubenstein, several of whom were subjects for Brooks's portraits.<br><br><i>Amazons in the Drawing Room</i>, published in conjunction with a major traveling exhibition of Brooks's work--the first since 1971--opening at the National Museum of Women in the Arts in June 2000, provides a fresh context to view Brooks's haunting and compelling art. Whitney Chadwick's overview of Brooks's life and artistic focus and Joe Luchesi's examination of Brooks's portraits and photographs of Russian dancer Ida Rubenstein bring into sharp focus the complex artistic, literary, and political influences that shaped Brooks's sensibility and approach to portraiture.<br><br></p><p>There can be few art historians better placed than Whitney Chadwick (<i>Women, Art, and Society</i>) to write the biographical essay that prefaces this catalog of the work of Romaine Brooks, the expatriate American artist more famous for her role in Natalie Barney's sapphic circle in Paris in the 1910s and 1920s than for her striking paintings. Anyone familiar with the birth of modern art will immediately note Brooks's influences, from Whistler to Klimt, Schiele, and Gauguin. What is less obvious is her advancement, as Chadwick argues, of an ideal of heroic femininity: even if it is an ironic ideal, as seen in her most remarkable and possibly best-known painting, the 1924 portrait of Una, Lady Troubridge, the lover of Radclyffe Hall, in morning coat and striped trousers, flanked by her dachshunds. While art history continues to privilege stylistic innovation over content, there is hope for the resuscitation of Brooks as perhaps the first painter to document a lesbian gaze, as in her beautiful profile of the short-haired, androgynous <i>Peter, A Young English Girl</i> (1923-4). The book includes an essay by Joe Lucheesi on Brooks's portraits of the dancer and mime Ida Rubinstein, one of her lovers. <i>--Regina Marler</i><b>Whitney Chadwick</b> is Professor of Art History at San Francisco State University and author of <i>Women, Art, and Society</i> (1990) as well as other books and articles on women in the arts and on surrealism. <b>Joe Lucchesi</b> is a visiting instructor of Art History at Carleton College, and curator of the exhibition of Brooks's art organized by the National Museum of Women in the Arts in Washington, D.C.</p><h2>Veterinary Technician&#39;s Daily Reference Guide: Canine and Feline</h2><p>This thorough, quick reference is perfectly sized to meet the needs of students and practicing veterinary technicians.

Settling in Orgeval, a small town near Paris, Paul and Hazel begain traveling widely, as Strand searched for "the perfect village" - where, sustained by hard and honest work, men and women coexisted harmoniously with nature and machines. Using large-format 8-by-10 and 4-by-5 cameras for most of his work and creating prints with four-dimensional depth and vibrancy, he sought to depict a timeless sense of community.<br><br><b>Catherine Duncan </b>met Paul and Hazel Strand soon after their arrival in Paris, in 1950. During the latter years of their friendship she worked closely with Strand on texts for his books and portfolios. Duncan lives in Paris, where she directs workshops on collage for the French Department of Education. She has published plays and essays, and <i>The Grandmother's Book, </i>for children.<br><br><b>Ute Eskildsen </b>has been director of the photographic department at the Museum Folkwang, in Essen, Germany, since 1979. Since 1975 she has organized an exhibition program devoted to contemporary photography. She previously assisted Otto Steinert at the University of Essen and worked as a freelance curator. Specializing in photography of the 1920s, she has published several monographs and catalogs.<br>Emigrating to Paris in 1950, American photographer Paul Strand (1890-1976) traveled widely with his wife Hazel Kingsbury across France, Italy, Romania and the Hebrides in search of an ideal village embodying an unbroken exchange between people, environment and nature. They also made photographic odysseys to Morocco, Ghana and Egypt. The 113 quietly moving photographs in this magical album capture the particularities of each region yet also speak of the common humanity of the people emphatically portrayed. Duncan, a Paris-based writer/artist who befriended the Strands in France, provides an informal reminiscence. Eskildsen, a German museum director, capably charts Strand's quest for a whole, organic lifestyle and its expression in his peripatetic work, which has received much less critical attention than his early pioneering pictures. <br>Copyright 1994 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>French Made Simple</h2><p>For almost four decades, <i>Made Simple</i> books have set the standard for continuing education and home study.

This pragmatic and flexible casebook covers searches and seizures, entrapment, confessions, identification procedures, and the exclusionary rules. The new Seventh Edition follows the same basic organizational structure and subject matter coverage as the prior edition (2008). The textual material at the beginning of each chapter and between main opinions is limited. And, a considerable number of problems, based on actual federal and state cases, are incorporated throughout the book. The problems both inform students of the sorts of issues currently being contested in the courts and provide them with opportunities to test their knowledge of the doctrines and principles by applying them to concrete situations. Finally, because some of the problems are cumulative, including issues covered in previous sections, they provide exercises for developing exam-taking skills. The cases presented in Criminal Procedure: Constitutional Constraints Upon Investigation and Proof are limited to those decided by the United States Supreme Court. The core objective has been to present a sufficient number of cases to enable students to gain an appreciation of the richness and complexity of the issues pertaining to each topic. Accordingly, some topics are the subject of several decisions that explore a variety of related issues. As with prior editions, however, there has been no attempt to cover every significant question or to present every Supreme Court decision relating to the topics addressed. The Seventh Edition includes edited versions of the Supreme Court's opinions in four cases decided since the last edition was published in 2008. It also includes substantial notes that capture the essence of other significant rulings in the past several years. In addition, a significant number of new problems, based on actual lower court opinions, have been incorporated throughout the book. Instructors will find intriguing new fact situations that raise novel, cutting-edge constitutional issues.</p></p><p>James J. Tomkovicz is Professor of Law at University of Iowa College of Law.

Unfettered markets, they argue, now drive the world, and all countries must adjust, no matter how painful this may be for some. Robert Gilpin, author of the widely acclaimed <i>Political Economy of International Relations</i> (Princeton, 1987), urges us, however, not to take an open and integrated global economy for granted. Rather, we must consider the political circumstances that have enabled global markets to function and the probability that these conditions will continue. Gilpin's new book amounts to a magisterial inquiry into all major aspects of the contemporary world political economy. Beginning with the 1989 end of the Cold War and the subsequent collapse of communism, it focuses on globalization and rapid technological change and covers a broad sweep of economic developments and political cultures. Gilpin demonstrates the fragility of a global and integrated economy and recommends what can be done to strengthen it.</p><br><p> The international community has another chance to solidify the global market economy that collapsed with the outbreak of World War I. Yet, writes Gilpin, the full implications of this historic development for international affairs are not yet clear. Will socialist economies make a successful transition to market-type economies? What role will a dynamic China play in the world economy? Will the United States continue to exercise leadership or gravitate toward self-centered policies? Gilpin explores such questions along with problems in the areas of trade liberalization, multinational corporations, and destabilizing financial flows. He also investigates the struggles of less developed countries and the spread of economic regionalism, particularly in Europe, North America, and Pacific Asia, which directly threatens an open world economy.</p><br><p> The author maintains that global capitalism and economic globalization have rested and must continue to rest on a secure political foundation. However, this foundation has eroded since the end of the Soviet threat. To ensure survival of the global economy, Gilpin concludes, the United States and other major powers must recommit themselves to working together to rebuild its weakened political foundations.</p></p><p>"Capitalism is the most successful wealth-creating economic system the world has ever known," declares Robert Gilpin. Yet it has skeptics. "Individual nations and powerful groups within nations that believe the world economy functions unfairly and to their disadvantage, or who wish to change the system to benefit themselves to the detriment of others, are an ever-present threat to the stability of the system." The task, then, is to ensure its survival through wise leadership that provides fair rules governing trade, investment, and currency. At a time when the economies of the world appear more linked than ever, and the tug of even further internationalization feels irresistible, Gilpin says nothing is inevitable. The whole system must rest on secure political foundations--foundations that Gilpin argues have weakened since the end of the cold war. "Growing concern over economic globalization and increased competition have intensified the movement toward economic regionalism and the appeal of protectionism," he writes. <i>The Challenge of Global Capitalism</i> was actually completed before the World Trade Organization's disastrous 1999 meeting in Seattle; after watching the protests unfold there, even the most Pollyannaish observers must admit that Gilpin warns of a real threat. His book will appeal mainly to economists, but serious nonspecialists will also find its sober prose accessible. <i>--John J. Miller</i><p>"<i>The Challenge of Global Capitalism</i> describes the opportunities, the complexities, and the risks inherent in the globalized economy with the clarity and breadth of analysis characteristic of Robert Gilpin. His cool and balanced appraisal is a needed antidote to the sense of triumphalism that characterizes too much of American thinking at the end of the century. Required reading for students of political economy."<b>--Paul A. Volcker, Former Chairman, Board of Governors, Federal Reserve</b></p><p>"The demise of the Soviet Empire did not bring about the new World Order. Indeed, 'market economy' and 'democracy' have become buzzwords for everybody. However, what we see today is increasingly unstable and under-governed global economy. Robert Gilpin's <i>The Challenge of Global Capitalism</i> explores what went wrong and convincingly calls for effective international leadership and strengthened cooperation among the major industrialized powers."<b>--Toyoo Gyohten, President of Institute for International Monetary Affairs</b></p><p>"<i>The Challenge of Global Capitalism</i> is an authoritative review of the major aspects of today's world political economy by the world's leading political scientist working on the subject. It offers a clear description of a whole array of contemporary issues, a sustained critique of the economist's viewpoint--the most cogent by a political scientist of which I am aware--and some genuinely new material for scholars and students. All of this is explained through the author's distinctive perspective."<b>--Robert O. Keohane, Duke University</b></p><p>"Robert Gilpin is among the giants in the field of international political economy. His new book reminds readers why. It also offers compelling evidence of an acute intelligence and a roving eye that misses nothing significant about the evolving world economy.

These poems are an expansive meditation on Baca's spiritual life, punctuated always with his feetrepeatedly, rhythmicallyon the ground as he runs every morning along the river. Baca contemplates his old life, his new love, his family and friends, those living and those dead, injustices and victories, and Chicano culture. As Denise Levertov remarked, Baca "writes with unconcealed passion" and "manifests both an intense lyricism and that transformative vision which perceives the mythical and archetypal significance of life events."</p><p>Jimmy Santiago Baca was born in Santa Fe, New Mexico, in 1952. His parents abandoned him at the age of two, and he lived with his grandmother for several years before being placed in an orphanage. A runaway at age thirteen, Baca was sentenced to five years in a maximum security prison at the age of twenty-one for drug offenses. It was in prison that he learned to read and write and began to compose poetry. His book Mart�n &amp; Meditations on the South Valley, a pair of long narrative poems, won an American Book Award in 1988. In addition to his poetry collections and stories, Baca wrote the screenplay for the movie Bound by Honor, which was released by Hollywood Pictures in 1993.The inspiring and romantic aura of the riverine Mexican border, its flora and its fauna suffuse this very clear book-length sequence from Baca, author of <i>Black Mesa Poems</i>, the memoir <i>A Place to Stand</i>, as well as books of stories and essays. These 39 poems-all long-lined, casual and determinedly optimistic-largely eschew the tales of hardship that mark earlier work, focusing instead on Baca's present-day projects and dreams; "running along this path every other day" through the river valley, he hopes to "keep my connection to the spirits strong,/ keep my work spiritual," explaining how "the river in me sings my gratefulness to you and others," "my grief rain-tears, my joyous natural-spring laughter." Baca seeks a Whitmanesque voice that aims toward human universals, while remaining grounded in his Chicano ancestry. A "Rio Grande bosque" (forest) "on the verge of bursting forth with spring" becomes an Edenic refuge and a symbol for everything and everyone else his speaker loves: his faith, his America, and (especially late in the book) the mother of his children: "you on the bed, nursing our son,/ your laughter a prayer to the wind." While many of the images and themes here are predictable, but readers who have followed Baca this far will certainly want to come along for his heartfelt exploration of the American Southwest and of "the contradictions/ that come with being human." <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

It shares with Attica, San Quentin, and Jackson the notoriety of being one of the maximum security prisons that has shaped the public's conception of imprisonment. In <i>Stateville</i> James B. Jacobs, a sociologist and legal scholar, presents the first historical examination of a total prison organization&#x2014;administrators, guards, prisoners, and special interest groups.<br> <br> Jacobs applies Edward Shils's interpretation of the dynamics of mass society in order to explain the dramatic events of the past quarter century that have permanently altered Stateville's structure. With the extension of civil rights to previously marginal groups such as racial minorities, the poor, and, ultimately, the incarcerated, prisons have moved from society's periphery toward its center. Accordingly Stateville's control mechanisms became less authoritarian and more legalistic and bureaucratic. As prisoners' rights increased, the preogatives of the staff were sharply curtailed. By the early 1970s the administration proved incapable of dealing with politicized gangs, proliferating interest groups, unionized guards, and interventionist courts.<br> <br> In addition to extensive archival research, Jacobs spent many months freely interacting with the prisoners, guards, and administrators at Stateville. His lucid presentation of Stateville's troubled history will provide fascinating reading for a wide audience of concerned readers.<br> <br> ". . .

Howards End, a house in the Herefordshire countryside, is the source of conflict between these parties-and ultimately a symbol of class conflict in England.</p><p>Margaret Schlegel, engaged to the much older, widowed Henry Wilcox, meets her intended the morning after accepting his proposal and realizes that he is a man who has lived without introspection or true self-knowledge. As she contemplates the state of Wilcox's soul, her remedy for what ails him has become one of the most oft-quoted passages in literature: <blockquote>Only connect! That was the whole of her sermon. Only connect the prose and the passion and both will be exalted, and human love will be seen at its height. Live in fragments no longer.</blockquote> Like all of Forster's work, <i>Howards End</i> concerns itself with class, nationality, economic status, and how each of these affects personal relationships. It follows the intertwined fortunes of the Schlegel sisters, Margaret and Helen, and the Wilcox family over the course of several years. The Schlegels are intellectuals, devotees of art and literature. The Wilcoxes, on the other hand, can't be bothered with the life of the mind or the heart, leading, instead, outer lives of "telegrams and anger" that foster "such virtues as neatness, decision, and obedience, virtues of the second rank, no doubt, but they have formed our civilization." Helen, after a brief flirtation with one of the Wilcox sons, has developed an antipathy for the family; Margaret, however, forms a brief but intense friendship with Mrs. Wilcox, which is cut short by the older woman's death. When her family discovers a scrap of paper requesting that Henry give their home, Howards End, to Margaret, it precipitates a spiritual crisis among them that will take years to resolve.<p> Forster's 1910 novel begins as a collection of seemingly unrelated events--Helen's impulsive engagement to Paul Wilcox; a chance meeting between the Schlegel sisters and an impoverished clerk named Leonard Bast at a concert; a casual conversation between the sisters and Henry Wilcox in London one night. But as it moves along, these disparate threads gradually knit into a tightly woven fabric of tragic misunderstandings, impulsive actions, and irreparable consequences, and, eventually, connection. Though set in the early years of the 20th century, <i>Howards End</i> seems even more suited to our own fragmented era of e-mails and anger. For readers living in such an age, the exhortation to "only connect" resonates ever more profoundly. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>9 1.5-hour cassettes</p><h2>Interviewing Clients across Cultures: A Practitioner&#39;s Guide</h2><p><p>Packed with practical pointers and examples, this indispensable, straight-talking guide helps professionals conduct productive interviews while building strong working relationships with culturally and linguistically diverse clients.

The reader feels welcomed, whatever his or her degree of comfort and knowledge, and is gently yet firmly taught how to work more effectively with clients from different backgrounds. Readers with little experience interviewing clients from other cultures will be given a framework in which to get started: knowledge about degrees of acculturation, things to think about when preparing for an interview, and how to build rapport....Each chapter includes questions for further thought and discussion, which could be used in teaching and supervision.

The country gave her a setting, and her companions, husband Percy Bysshe Shelley and their friend Lord Byron, sparked her imagination with philosophical discussions about the reanimation of the dead. When poor weather kept them housebound, they devised a story-writing contest -- and Mary set out to create a tale "to make the reader dread to look around, to curdle the blood, and quicken the beatings of the heart." The story of Victor Frankenstein, a scientist who oversteps the bounds of conscience, and the monster he creates, was a bestseller in its day -- and remains one of the most spellbinding novels of all time. <p> Washington Square Press' Enriched Classics present the great works of world literature enhanced for the contemporary reader. This edition of <i>Frankenstein</i> was prepared by Anne K. Mellor, professor of English and women's studies at the University of California in Los Angeles. It includes an introduction, a selection of critical excerpts, suggestions for further reading, and a unique visual essay of drawings and photographs.</p></p><p><i>Frankenstein,</i> loved by many decades of readers and praised by such eminent literary critics as Harold Bloom, seems hardly to need a recommendation. If you haven't read it recently, though, you may not remember the sweeping force of the prose, the grotesque, surreal imagery, and the multilayered <i>doppelg�nger</i> themes of Mary Shelley's masterpiece. As fantasy writer Jane Yolen writes of this (the reviewer's favorite) edition, "The strong black and whites of the main text [illustrations] are dark and brooding, with unremitting shadows and stark contrasts. But the central conversation with the monster--who owes nothing to the overused movie image ... but is rather the novel's charnel-house composite--is where [Barry] Moser's illustrations show their greatest power ... The viewer can all but smell the powerful stench of the monster's breath as its words spill out across the page. Strong book-making for one of the world's strongest and most remarkable books."

Similarly, the upward spiral of college tuition fees is cause for serious concern. In this concise and illuminating book,&nbsp;the well-known economist William J. Baumol explores the causes of these seemingly intractable problems and offers a surprisingly simple explanation. Baumol identifies the "cost disease" as a major source of rapidly rising costs in service sectors of the economy. Once we understand that disease, he explains, effective responses become apparent.</p><p>Baumol presents his analysis with characteristic clarity, tracing the fast-rising prices of health care and education in the United States and other major industrial nations, then examining the underlying causes, which have to do with the nature of providing labor-intensive services. The news is good, Baumol reassures us, because the nature of the disease is such that society will be able to afford the rising costs.</p></p><p><b>William J.

It is based on taking a scientific approach to cooking&nbsp;- an activity that has traditionally been regarded as an art, rather than a science. Topics range from the simple (what is the role of salt in cooking vegetables?) to the complex (separating volatile flavour components in foods by gas chromatography mass spectrometry), to the 'just for fun' (breaking the world record for ice cream making by using liquid nitrogen as a coolant). What the RSC has done is to provide flexible material that teachers can 'dip into' that relates the chemistry that goes on in the home or restaurant kitchen to that which students learn about in the school curriculum.<br><br><em>Kitchen chemistry </em>makes chemistry more accessible because it brings together scientific theory and everyday practicality. After all, we all know something about cooking even though we may not do it very often, and children are no different. When I left school I had no scientific background whatsoever.

Those dissidents left behind their own secret legacies. One of those is Merlyn Athrawes, cybernetic avatar of one of Earth's long-dead defenders, now reawakened after a thousand years to restart human progress and reclaim our place in the universe.

This was family life in the new era of the A-bomb. This was civil defense. In this provocative work of social and political history, Laura McEnaney takes us into the secretive world of defense planners and the homes of ordinary citizens to explore how postwar civil defense turned the front lawn into the front line. The reliance on atomic weaponry as a centerpiece of U.S. foreign policy cast a mushroom cloud over everyday life. American citizens now had to imagine a new kind of war, one in which they were both combatants and targets. It was the Federal Civil Defense Administration's job to encourage citizens to adapt to their nuclear present and future.</p><p>As McEnaney demonstrates, the creation of a civil defense program produced new dilemmas about the degree to which civilian society should be militarized to defend itself against internal and external threats. Conflicts arose about the relative responsibilities of state and citizen to fund and implement a home-front security program. The defense establishment's resolution was to popularize and privatize military preparedness. The doctrine of "self-help" defense demanded that citizens become autonomous rather than rely on the federal government for protection. Families would reconstitute themselves as paramilitary units that could quash subversion from within and absorb attack from without.</p><p>Because it solicited an unprecedented degree of popular involvement, the FCDA offers a unique opportunity to explore how average citizens, community leaders, and elected officials both participated in and resisted the creation of the national security state. Drawing on a wide variety of archival sources, McEnaney uncovers the broad range of responses to this militarization of daily life and reveals how government planners and ordinary people negotiated their way at the dawn of the atomic age. Her work sheds new light on the important postwar debate about what total military preparedness would actually mean for American society.</p></p><p><p>"This book argues compellingly that the debate over civil defense in the 1950s contributed significantly to the militarization of American culture. McEnaney's real contribution is to broaden our understanding of military and domestic policy in the 1950s. Her work on gender is extremely important here, and her final chapter on race and class adds an important dimension to our sense of Cold War military policy."<b>--Allan M.

But as scientist Daniel Botkin argues in this provocative book, our ability to solve these problems is limited--not by our scientific knowledge--but by the age-old myths and metaphors that shape our perception of the natural world. Indeed, our beliefs about nature have fallen well behind our knowledge. <br> Daniel Botkin is a seasoned scientist. He has spent three decades in the field studying the changes and interactions of forests and animal species. In the 1970s he pioneered the use of computers to predict ecological trends. Now, in <em>Discordant Harmonies</em>, he combines his considerable expertise with the well-honed eye of the nature writer and a philosopher's sense of how ideas shape our perceptions of reality to take us on a marvelous guided tour of the natural world. His method is to introduce a problem in our beliefs about nature by giving us a fascinating case study: of predator-prey relationships, of forests evolving over centuries, of species nearing extinction, of the ways our "protection" of nature has had surprising--and often disappointing--results. Botkin's revealing case studies also highlight controversial present-day issues--like controlled burning in national forests, fishing and hunting quotas, and policy-making for management of natural resources. He looks at each of these cases in the light of past thinking and current research, revealing how old myths often blind us to the new technology and to the ways of thinking we need to solve our environmental problems. Above all, Botkin is concerned with redefining the relationship between human beings and nature, so that our needs can be met and the intricate systems of nature can persist.<br> Whether discussing moose herds on Isle Royale or Yosemite's famous Mariposa Grove of Sequoias, Botkin writes vividly and insightfully about nature, challenging us to rethink some of our most cherished notions. Anyone who is concerned about the environment will find much here to ponder as well as the pleasure of meeting a stimulating and thoughtful mind at work.</p><p><br><strong>Daniel B.

During his brief life in Poland, Paris, and Vienna, Kelles-Krauz influenced or infuriated most of the leaders of the various socialist movements of Central Europe and France. His central ideas ultimately were not accepted by the socialist mainstream at the time of his death. However, a century later, we see that they anticipated late twentieth-century understanding on the importance of nationalism as a social force and the parameters of socialism in political theory and praxis. Kelles-Krauz was one of the only theoreticians of his age to advocate Jewish national rights as being equivalent to, for example, Polish national rights, and he correctly saw the struggle for national sovereignty as being central to future events in Europe. This was the first major monograph in English devoted to Kelles-Krauz, and it includes maps and personal photographs of Kelles-Krauz, his colleagues, and his family.<br></p><p><br><strong>Timothy Snyder</strong> is Richard C. Levin Professor of History at Yale University. He is the author and editor of numerous award-winning and bestselling books including <em>The Reconstruction of Nations: Poland, Ukraine, Lithuania, Belarus, 1569-1999</em>; <em>Sketches from a Secret War: A Polish Artist's Mission to</em> <em>Liberate Soviet Ukraine</em>; <em>The Red Prince: The Secret Lives of a Habsburg Archduke</em>; <em>Bloodlands: Europe Between Hitler and Stalin; Black Earth: The Holocaust as History and Warning</em>; and <em>On Tyranny</em>. This was his first book.<br><br>"In his magisterial Nationalism, Marxism, and Modern Central Europe...Timothy Snyder re-evaluates an intellectual prodigy whose death from tuberculosis at the tragically early age of thirty-three robbed Polish socialism of a political talent to rival that of more long-lived luminaries....In this mission of rehabilitation but not canonization, Snyder has been indefatigable in his original research and scrupulous in his overall judgement....[His] thoughtful investigation into the world so briefly inhabited by Kelles-Krauz is richly informative, with illuminating insights into, in particular, the divisive but ineffectual squabbles endemic to the international socialist intelligentsia and the lonely, suicide-prone existence of the political existence of the political <em>emigr�</em>."--Raymond Pearson, <em>English Historical Review</em><p></p><br>"This work is an impressive intellectual biography of a Polish socialist, Kazimierz Kelles-Krauz. While little known outside of Poland, his writings occupy a key position in the Marxist debates from the turn of the century concerning nationalism and the aspirations for national independence of different nationalities in the large European empires. In writing this biography of Kelles-Krauz, Snyder has given us a comprehensive intellectual portrait of an entire age. His discussion of the main issues of the time is sweeping in scope, and he has provided meticulous references to guide the reader to the source material. The book presupposes some familiarity with the topic, but will be very useful to any serious reader interested in a more complete understanding of the emergence of modern nationalism, as well as of the debates within the socialist movement in response to this phenomenon."--James H. Satterwhite, <em>Slavic and East European Journal</em><p></p><br>"What Snyder offers is a stimulating political and intellectual biography of an overlooked theoretician from the gentry intelligentsia. This political class brought modern political parties to Russian Poland, led these parties, and built the Second Republic. . . Snyder establishes Kelles-Krauz's place within Polish political history alongside Pilsudski, Luxemburg, Max Weber, and Gyorgy Lukacs...The biography is intellectually rich and challenging scholarship. It rests upon an extensive reading of politics, history, sociology, philosophy, and economy and enlarges our knowledge of European and Polish socialism."--Stanislaus A. Blejwas, <em>Slavic Review</em><p></p><br>"It is a Polish paradox that the leading theorist of the main current in Polish socialism was of baronian German origin...He was actually exceptional in several respects: he justified the nation-state when Marxists in general rejected it...The history of socialism and communism in eastern Europe is definitely fascinating. Not being able to survive in their home countries, the local leftists moved to Paris, London, Berlin, Bern, Brussels, etc. On the one hand they directly or indirectly gave support to the Western leftist movements and on the other hand they themselves willingly or unwillingly were exposed to foreign influences. Kelles-Krauz himself was definitely open-minded and therefore absorbed much democratic thinking...It is no surprise that he was unpopular among them and under Soviet rule in Poland as well as in pro-Soviet neighboring countries his writings were ignored. It is very good indeed that Timothy Snyder has remembered him."--Alexander J. Marejko, <em>Polish Review</em><p></p><br>"The book reveals the testimony of a great thinker and passionate politician, whose ideas are as candid today as they were almost a hundred years ago....The idea that nationality is a consciousness rather than blood, geography, and language indicates Kelles-Krauz's understanding of the difference between ethnicity and nationality as it is presented today by social scientists....The author shows himself to be a meticulous and erudite researcher. I applaud Timothy Snyder for his craftsmanship in presenting Kazimierz Kelles-Kraux to the academic world of the late twentieth century."--Ludomir R. Lozny, <em>Canadian Slavonic Papers</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Stories From The Kitchen</h2><p>Stories-from-the-Kitchen</p><p>Diana Secker Tesdell is the editor of several short-story anthologies in the Pocket Classics series, including Love Stories, Dog Stories and Stories of Art and Artists.Charles Dickens, "Love and Oysters"<br><br>If we had to make a classification of society, there is a particular kind of men whom we should immediately set down under the head of &#x2018;&#x2018;Old Boys&#x2019;&#x2019;, and a column of most extensive dimensions the old boys would require. To what precise causes the rapid advance of old-boy population is to be traced, we are unable to determine. It would be an interesting and curious speculation, but, as we have not sufficient space to devote to it here, we simply state the fact that the numbers of the old boys have been gradually augmenting within the last few years, and that they are at this moment alarmingly on the increase.<br> &nbsp;<br> Upon a general review of the subject, and without considering it minutely in detail, we should be disposed to subdivide the old boys into two distinct classes&#x2014;the gay old boys, and the steady old boys. The gay old boys are paunchy old men in the disguise of young ones, who frequent the Quadrant and Regent-street in the day-time: the theatres (especially theatres under lady management) at night; and who assume all the foppishness and levity of boys, without the excuse of youth or inexperience. The steady old boys are certain stout old gentlemen of clean appearance, who are always to be seen in the same taverns, at the same hours every evening, smoking and drinking in the same company.<br> &nbsp;<br> There was once a fine collection of old boys to be seen round the circular table at Offley&#x2019;s every night, between the hours of half-past eight and half-past eleven. We have lost sight of them for some time. There were, and may be still, for aught we know, two splendid specimens in full blossom at the Rainbow Tavern in Fleet-street, who always used to sit in the box nearest the fireplace, and smoked long cherry-stick pipes which went under the table, with the bowls resting on the floor. Grand old boys they were&#x2014;fat, red-faced, whiteheaded old fellows&#x2014;always there&#x2014;one on one side the table, and the other opposite&#x2014;puffing and drinking away in great state. Everybody knew them, and it was supposed by some people that they were both immortal.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. John Dounce was an old boy of the latter class (we don&#x2019;t mean immortal, but steady), a retired glove and braces maker, a widower, resident with three daughters&#x2014;all grown up, and all unmarried&#x2014;in Cursitor-street, Chancery-lane. He was a short, round, large-faced, tubbish sort of man, with a broad-brimmed hat, and a square coat; and had that grave, but confident, kind of roll, peculiar to old boys in general. Regular as clockwork&#x2014;breakfast at nine&#x2014;dress and titivate a little&#x2014;down to the Sir Somebody&#x2019;s Head&#x2014;a glass of ale and the paper&#x2014;come back again, and take daughters out for a walk&#x2014;dinner at three&#x2014;glass of grog and pipe&#x2014;nap&#x2014;tea&#x2014;little walk&#x2014;Sir Somebody&#x2019;sHead again&#x2014;capital house&#x2014;delightful evenings. There were Mr. Harris, the lawstationer, and Mr. Jennings, the robe-maker (two jolly young fellows like himself ), and Jones, the barrister&#x2019;s clerk&#x2014;rum fellow that Jones&#x2014;capital company&#x2014;full of anecdote!&#x2014;and there they sat every night till just ten minutes before twelve, drinking their brandy-and-water, and smoking their pipes, and telling stories, and enjoying themselves with a kind of solemn joviality particularly edifying.<br> &nbsp;<br> Sometimes Jones would propose a half-price visit to Drury Lane or Covent Garden, to see two acts of a five-act play, and a new farce, perhaps, or a ballet, on which occasions the whole four of them went together: none of your hurrying and nonsense, but having their brandy-and-water first, comfortably, and ordering a steak and some oysters for their supper against they came back, and then walking coolly into the pit, when the &#x2018;&#x2018;rush&#x2019;&#x2019; had gone in, as all sensible people do, and did when Mr. Dounce was a young man, except when the celebrated Master Betty was at the height of his popularity, and then, sir,&#x2014;then&#x2014;Mr. Dounce perfectly well remembered getting a holiday from business; and going to the pit doors at eleven o&#x2019;clock in the forenoon, and waiting there, till six in the afternoon, with some sandwiches in a pocket-handkerchief and some wine in a phial; and fainting after all, with the heat and fatigue, before the play began; in which situation he was lifted out of the pit, into one of the dress boxes, sir, by five of the finest women of that day, sir, who compassionated his situation and administered restoratives, and sent a black servant, six foot high, in blue and silver livery, next morning with their compliments, and to know how he found himself, sir&#x2014;by G&#x2014;! Between the acts Mr. Dounce and Mr. Harris, and Mr. Jennings, used to stand up, and look round the house, and Jones&#x2014;knowing fellow that Jones&#x2014;knew everybody&#x2014;pointed out the fashionable and celebrated Lady So-and-So in the boxes, at the mention of whose name Mr. Dounce, after brushing up his hair, and adjusting his neckerchief, would inspect the aforesaid Lady So-and-So through an immense glass, and remark, either, that she was a &#x2018;&#x2018;fine woman&#x2014;very fine woman, indeed,&#x2019;&#x2019; or that &#x2018;&#x2018;there might be a little more of her, eh, Jones?&#x2019;&#x2019; Just as the case might happen to be. When the dancing began, John Dounce and the other old boys were particularly anxious to see what was going forward on the stage, and Jones&#x2014;wicked dog that Jones&#x2014;whispered little critical remarks into the ears of John Dounce, which John Dounce retailed to Mr. Harris and Mr. Harris to Mr. Jennings; and then they all four laughed, until the tears ran down out of their eyes.<br> &nbsp;<br> When the curtain fell, they walked back together, two and two, to the steaks and oysters; and when they came to the second glass of brandy-and-water, Jones&#x2014;hoaxing scamp, that Jones&#x2014;used to recount how he had observed a lady in white feathers, in one of the pit boxes, gazing intently on Mr. Dounce all the evening, and how he had caught Mr. Dounce, whenever he thought no one was looking at him, bestowing ardent looks of intense devotion on the lady in return; on which Mr. Harris and Mr. Jennings used to laugh very heartily, and John Dounce more heartily than either of them, acknowledging, however, that the time HAD been when he MIGHT have done such things; upon which Mr. Jones used to poke him in the ribs, and tell him he had been a sad dog in his time, which John Dounce with chuckles confessed. And after Mr. Harris and Mr. Jennings had preferred their claims to the character of having been sad dogs too, they separated harmoniously, and trotted home.<br> &nbsp;<br> The decrees of Fate, and the means by which they are brought about, are mysterious and inscrutable. John Dounce had led this life for twenty years and upwards, without wish for change, or care for variety, when his whole social system was suddenly upset and turned completely topsy-turvy&#x2014;not by an earthquake, or some other dreadful convulsion of nature, as the reader would be inclined to suppose, but by the simple agency of an oyster; and thus it happened.<br> &nbsp;<br> Mr. John Dounce was returning one night from the Sir Somebody&#x2019;s Head, to his residence in Cursitor-street&#x2014;not tipsy, but rather excited, for it was Mr. Jennings&#x2019;s birthday, and they had had a brace of partridges for supper, and a brace of extra glasses afterwards, and Jones had been more than ordinarily amusing&#x2014;when his eyes rested on a newly opened oyster-shop, on a magnificent scale, with natives laid, one deep, in circular marble basins in the windows, together with little round barrels of oysters directed to Lords and Baronets, and Colonels and Captains, in every part of the habitable globe.<br> &nbsp;<br> Behind the natives were the barrels, and behind the barrels was a young lady of about five-and-twenty, all in blue, and all alone&#x2014;splendid creature, charming face and lovely figure! It is difficult to say whether Mr. John Dounce&#x2019;s red countenance, illuminated as it was by the flickering gaslight in the window before which he paused, excited the lady&#x2019;s risibility, or whether a natural exuberance of animal spirits proved too much for that staidness of demeanour which the forms of society rather dictatorially prescribe. But certain it is, that the lady smiled; then put her finger upon her lip, with a striking recollection of what was due to herself; and finally retired, in oyster-like bashfulness, to the very back of the counter. The sad-dog sort of feeling came strongly upon John Dounce: he lingered&#x2014;the lady in blue made no sign. He coughed&#x2014;still she came not. He entered the shop.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;Can you open me an oyster, my dear?&#x2019;&#x2019; said Mr. John Dounce.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;Dare say I can, sir,&#x2019;&#x2019; replied the lady in blue, with playfulness. And Mr. John Dounce ate one oyster, and then looked at the young lady, and then ate another, and then squeezed the young lady&#x2019;s hand as she was opening the third, and so forth, until he had devoured a dozen of those at eightpence in less than no time.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;Can you open me half-a-dozen more, my dear?&#x2019;&#x2019; inquired Mr. John Dounce.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll see what I can do for you, sir,&#x2019;&#x2019; replied the young lady in blue, even more bewitchingly than before; and Mr. John Dounce ate half-a-dozen more of those at eightpence.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;You couldn&#x2019;t manage to get me a glass of brandy-and-water, my dear, I suppose?&#x2019;&#x2019; said Mr. John Dounce, when he had finished the oysters: in a tone which clearly implied his supposition that she could.<br> &nbsp;<br> &#x2018;&#x2018;I&#x2019;ll see, sir,&#x2019;&#x2019; said the young lady: and away she ran out of the shop, and down the street, her long auburn ringlets shaking in the wind in the most enchanting manner; and back she came again, tripping over the coal-cellar lids like a whipping- top, with a tumbler of brandy-and-water, which Mr. John Dounce insisted on her taking a share of, as it was regular ladies&#x2019; grog&#x2014;hot, strong, sweet, and plenty of it.<br> &nbsp;<br> So, the young lady sat down with Mr. John Dounce, in a little red box with a green curtain, and took a small sip of the brandy-and-water, and a small look at Mr. John Dounce, and then turned her head away, and went through various other serio-pantomimic fascinations, which forcibly reminded Mr. John Dounce of the first time he courted his first wife, and which made him feel more affectionate than ever; in pursuance of which affection, and actuated by which feeling, Mr. John Dounce sounded the young lady on her matrimonial engagements, when the young lady denied having formed any such engagements at all&#x2014;she couldn&#x2019;t abear the men, they were such deceivers; thereupon Mr. John Dounce inquired whether this sweeping condemnation was meant to include other than very young men; on which the young lady blushed deeply&#x2014;at least she turned away her head, and said Mr. John Dounce had made her blush, so of course she DID blush&#x2014;and Mr. John Dounce was a long time drinking the brandy-and-water; and, at last, John Dounce went home to bed, and dreamed of his first wife, and his second wife, and the young lady, and partridges, and oysters, and brandy-and-water, and disinterested attachments.<br> &nbsp;<br> The next morning, John Dounce was rather feverish with the extra brandy-and-water of the previous night; and, partly in the hope of cooling himself with an oyster, and partly with the view of ascertaining whether he owed the young lady anything, or not, went back to the oyster-shop. If the young lady had appeared beautiful by night, she was perfectly irresistible by day; and, from this time forward, a change came over the spirit of John Dounce&#x2019;s dream. He bought shirtpins; wore a ring on his third finger; read poetry; bribed a cheap miniature-painter to perpetrate a faint resemblance to a youthful face, with a curtain over his head, six large books in the background, and an open country in the distance (this he called his portrait); &#x2018;&#x2018;went on&#x2019;&#x2019; altogether in such an uproarious manner, that the three Miss Dounces went off on small pensions, he having made the tenement in Cursitorstreet too warm to contain them; and in short, comported and demeaned himself in every respect like an unmitigated old Saracen, as he was.<br> &nbsp;<br> As to his ancient friends, the other old boys, at the Sir Somebody&#x2019;s Head, he dropped off from them by gradual degrees; for, even when he did go there, Jones&#x2014;vulgar fellow that Jones&#x2014;persisted in asking &#x2018;&#x2018;when it was to be?&#x2019;&#x2019; and &#x2018;&#x2018;whether he was to have any gloves?&#x2019;&#x2019; together with other inquiries of an equally offensive nature: at which not only Harris laughed, but Jennings also; so, he cut the two, altogether, and attached himself solely to the blue young lady at the smart oyster-shop.<br> &nbsp;<br> Now comes the moral of the story&#x2014;for it has a moral after all. The last-mentioned young lady, having derived sufficient profit and emolument from John Dounce&#x2019;s attachment, not only refused, when matters came to a crisis, to take him for better for worse, but expressly declared, to use her own forcible words, that she &#x2018;&#x2018;wouldn&#x2019;t have him at no price&#x2019;&#x2019;; and John Dounce, having lost his old friends, alienated his relations, and rendered himself ridiculous to everybody, made offers successively to a schoolmistress, a landlady, a feminine tobacconist, and a housekeeper; and, being directly rejected by each and every of them, was accepted by his cook, with whom he now lives, a henpecked husband, a melancholy monument of antiquated misery, and a living warning to all uxorious old boys.</p><h2>Job Searcher&#39;s Handbook, The</h2><p><p>This book is designed to provide simple, step by step instructions to help the student through the entire job searching process.

"Architecture is, and must be, a synthesis of technology and art." </p><p> Using nearly 200 drawings and photographs, including plans, interesting details, various stages of construction, and both interior and exterior views of some of his major works, Mr. Nervi shows how his philosophy is put into practice. Referring to most of his important projects, he discusses solutions to various functional and construction requirements where he used precast and cast-in-place concrete, emphasizing the richness of this material. Mr. Nervi stresses the advantages of reinforced concrete, which, he says, allows greater flexibility and makes it easier to satisfy his triple demand of economy, technical correctness, and aesthetic satisfaction. </p><p> In predicting the future of architecture he stresses the necessity of architectural solutions that are functionally and technically sound. His final remarks concern his ideas about the proper course of study for architecture students, training that will produce architects with a "far greater technical sense than in the past, a technical sense which results in a constant search for economic efficiency." </p></p><p></p><h2>Extraterrestrial Archaeology</h2><p>This book is about Extra Terrestrial Archaeology.

A Critical Companion to Beowulf addresses these and other issues, reviewing and synthesising previous scholarship, as well as offering fresh perspectives. After an initial introduction to the poem, attention is focused on such matters as the manuscript context and approaches to dating the poem; the particular style, diction, and structure of this most idiosyncratic of Old English texts; the background to the poem (considered not simply with respect to historical and legendary material, but also in the context of myth and fable); the specific roles of selected individual characters, both major and minor; and the original intended audience and perceived purpose of the poem. A final chapter describes the range of critical approaches which have been applied to the poem in the past, and points towards directions for future study.

A castle at the foot of the Carpathian mountains in the 1930s. Two men, inseparable in their youth, meet for the first time in forty-one years. They have spent their lives waiting for this moment. Four decades earlier a murky, traumatic event - something to do with a betrayal, and a woman - led to their sudden separation. Now, as their lives draw to a close, the devastating truth about that moment will be revealed. Embers is a masterpiece - an unforgettable story of passion, fidelity, truth and deception.</p><p>In S�ndor M�rai's <i>Embers</i>, two old men, once the best of friends, meet after a 41-year break in their relationship. They dine together, taking the same places at the table that they had assumed on the last meal they shared, then sit beside each other in front of a dying fire, one of them nearly silent, the other one, his host, slowly and deliberately tracing the course of their dead friendship. This sensitive, long-considered elaboration of one man's lifelong grievance is as gripping as any adventure story and explains why M�rai's forgotten 1942 masterpiece is being compared with the work of Thomas Mann. In some ways, M�rai's work is more modern than Mann's. His brevity, simplicity, and succinct, unadorned lyricism may call to mind Latin American novelists like Gabriel Garc�a M�rquez, or even Italo Calvino. It is the tone of magical realism, although M�rai's work is only magical in the sense that he completely engages his reader, spinning a web of words as his wounded central character describes his betrayal and abandonment at the hands of his closest friend. Even the setting, an old castle, evokes dark fairy tales. <p> The story of the rediscovery of <i>Embers</i> is as fascinating as the novel itself. A celebrated Hungarian novelist of the 1930s, M�rai survived the war but was persecuted by the Communists after they came to power. His books were suppressed, even destroyed, and he was forced to flee his country in 1948. He died in San Diego in 1989, one year before the neglected <i>Embers</i> was finally reprinted in his native land. This reprint was discovered by the Italian writer and publisher Roberto Calasso, and the subsequent editions have become international bestsellers. All of M�rai's novels are now slated for American publication. <i>--Regina Marler</i></p>Originally published in 1942 and now rediscovered to international acclaim, this taut and exquisitely structured novel by the Hungarian master Sandor Marai conjures the melancholy glamour of a decaying empire and the disillusioned wisdom of its last heirs. <br>In a secluded woodland castle an old General prepares to receive a rare visitor, a man who was once his closest friend but who he has not seen in forty-one years. Over the ensuing hours host and guest will fight a duel of words and silences, accusations and evasions. They will exhume the memory of their friendship and that of the General's beautiful, long-dead wife. And they will return to the time the three of them last sat together following a hunt in the nearby forest--a hunt in which no game was taken but during which something was lost forever. Embers is a classic of modern European literature, a work whose poignant evocation of the past also seems like a prophetic glimpse into the moral abyss of the present</p><h2>Frida Kahlo and Diego Rivera (Pegasus Library--Paperback Editions)</h2><p>The stormy relationship, artistic differences, and ideological common ground shared by Mexico&#39;s two greatest contemporary artists are portrayed here in a celebration of their contributions to art.</p><p>Present-day perceptions of Mexican art are dominated by Frida Kahlo, whose powerful self-portraits and portrayals of emotional trauma have gained enormous popularity.

In this same way, the volume focuses on the debates and conflicts among the Transcendentalists about such political questions as abolition, women&#39;s rights, westward expansion, and industrialization. This volume will represent effectively the struggles of Emerson and Fuller to change their philosophical views in response to the political crises of their times.About This Series Introduction A Note on the Texts I.

While excellent technical treatises have been written about specialized fields, they provide little help for the nonspecialist; and other books, some of them semipopular in nature, give an overview of mathematics while omitting some necessary details. <i>Fundamentals of Mathematics</i> strikes a unique balance, presenting an irreproachable treatment of specialized fields and at the same time providing a very clear view of their interrelations, a feature of great value to students, instructors, and those who use mathematics in applied and scientific endeavors. Moreover, as noted in a review of the German edition in <i>Mathematical Reviews</i>, the work is "designed to acquaint [the student] with modern viewpoints and developments. The articles are well illustrated and supplied with references to the literature, both current and 'classical.'"<br> <br> The outstanding pedagogical quality of this work was made possible only by the unique method by which it was written. There are, in general, two authors for each chapter: one a university researcher, the other a teacher of long experience in the German educational system. (In a few cases, more than two authors have collaborated.) And the whole book has been coordinated in repeated conferences, involving altogether about 150 authors and coordinators.<br> <br> <b>Volume I</b> opens with a section on mathematical foundations. It covers such topics as axiomatization, the concept of an algorithm, proofs, the theory of sets, the theory of relations, Boolean algebra, and antinomies. The closing section, on the real number system and algebra, takes up natural numbers, groups, linear algebra, polynomials, rings and ideals, the theory of numbers, algebraic extensions of a fields, complex numbers and quaternions, lattices, the theory of structure, and Zorn's lemma.<br> <br> <b>Volume II</b> begins with eight chapters on the foundations of geometry, followed by eight others on its analytic treatment. The latter include discussions of affine and Euclidean geometry, algebraic geometry, the Erlanger Program and higher geometry, group theory approaches, differential geometry, convex figures, and aspects of topology.<br> <br> <b>Volume III</b>, on analysis, covers convergence, functions, integral and measure, fundamental concepts of probability theory, alternating differential forms, complex numbers and variables, points at infinity, ordinary and partial differential equations, difference equations and definite integrals, functional analysis, real functions, and analytic number theory.

The modern South serves up a groaning board of international cuisines virtually unknown to previous generations of Southerners, notes Brett Anderson in his introduction. Southern food, like the increasingly globalized South, shows an open and cosmopolitan attitude toward ethnic diversity. But fully appreciating Southern food still requires fluency with the region&#x2019;s history, warts and all. The essays, memoirs, poetry, and profiles in this book are informed by that fluency, revealing topics and people traditional as well as avant garde, down home as well as urbane.</p><p>The book is organized into six chapters: &#x201c;Menu Items&#x201d; shares ruminations on iconic dishes; &#x201c;Messing with Mother Nature&#x201d; looks at the relationship between food and the natural environment; &#x201c;Southern Characters&#x201d; profiles an eclectic mix of food notables; &#x201c;Southern Drinkways&#x201d; distills libations, hard and soft; &#x201c;Identity in Motion&#x201d; examines change in the Southern food world; and &#x201c;The Global South&#x201d; leaves readers with some final thoughts on the cross-cultural influences wafting from the Southern kitchen. Gathered here are enough prominent food writers to muster the liveliest of dinner parties: Molly O&#x2019;Neill, Calvin Trillin, Michael Pollan, Kim Severson, Martha Foose, Jessica Harris, Bill Addison, Matt and Ted Lee, and Lolis Eric Elie, among others. Two classic pieces&#x2015;Frederick Douglass&#x2019;s account of the sustenance of slaves and Edward Behr&#x2019;s 1995 profile of Cajun cook Eula Mae Dor�&#x2015;are included.

The breadth of this collection is inspiring. To be able to read Frederick Douglass next to Edward Behr and Michael Pollan is exciting to me.

Feinman University of Wisconsin&#x2015;Madison "To understand the evolution of the world's political economy, we need empirical theories that can handle 'ancient' and 'modern' processes, a longer time frame encompassing multiple millennia, and less concern about trespassing in other people's disciplines. Chase-Dunn and Hall's new book, Rise and Demise, delivers all three with noteworthy style and effect." &#x2015;William Thompson Indiana University "Rise and Demise is a wide ranging and stimulating synthesis of the world-systems approach and its main findings.

Heaven is, after all, where God is and where good people go after death to receive their reward. But how and why did Western cultures come to imagine the heavenly realm in such terms? Why is heaven usually thought to be "up there," far beyond the visible sky? And what is the source of the idea that the post mortem abode of the righteous is in this heavenly realm with God? <br> <br> Seeking to discover the roots of these familiar notions, this volume traces the backgrounds, origin, and development of early Jewish and Christian speculation about the heavenly realm -- where it is, what it looks like, and who its inhabitants are. Wright begins his study with an examination of the beliefs of ancient Israel's neighbors Egypt and Mesopotamia, reconstructing the intellectual context in which the earliest biblical images of heaven arose. A detailed analysis of the Hebrew biblical texts themselves then reveals that the Israelites were deeply influenced by images drawn from the surrounding cultures. Wright goes on to examine Persian and Greco-Roman beliefs, thus setting the stage for his consideration of early Jewish and Christian images, which he shows to have been formed in the struggle to integrate traditional biblical imagery with the newer Hellenistic ideas about the cosmos. In a final chapter Wright offers a brief survey of how later Jewish, Christian, and Islamic traditions envisioned the heavenly realms. Accessible to a wide range of readers, this provocative book will interest anyone who is curious about the origins of this extraordinarily pervasive and influential idea.<br></p><p>J. Edward Wright is at University of Arizona.Wright (Near Eastern studies, Univ. of Arizona) here delves into the origin and early development of Jewish and Christian thought about heaven and whether humans can go there. Examining ancient Near Eastern and Greco-Roman cultural contexts, biblical and extrabiblical texts, and archaeological findings, he explores a diversity of Jewish and Christian views about the cosmos and the afterlife. He accords the beliefs reflected in the Old and New Testament minority status and portrays them as a tool used by the religious elite (responsible for the final form of the canon) to control the masses and guard their own power and privilege. A number of Wright's statements regarding the wielding of heaven (and hell) as implements of compliance are polemical, making his work seem unbalanced, and since many of his sources are not in English, most general readers will be unable to evaluate his case. But he provides a more in-depth look at this period than Colleen McDannell and Bernhard Lang (Heaven: A History) or Jeffrey Burton Russell (A History of Heaven: The Singing Silence).

Showing no aptitude for a manual trade, he joined the Carmelite Order in 1563 and was ordained to the priesthood in 1567. Under the influence of Saint Teresa of �vila, John worked to revive the primitive monastic rule, often against the wishes of religious authorities. Despite periods of imprisonment and banishment and almost continual harassment, John persisted in his advocacy of monastic reform and wrote many of his greatest poems and other works under extreme duress.<br> Achieve union with God<br> <br> John of the Cross is best known as one of the Church&#x2019;s great mystical theologians, and the central theme of his mysticism is that through a life of pure faith and love of God, the soul may attain union with the Divine. As your retreat master and companion, John challenges you to become like Christ &#x2014; to be wounded and suffer with Him, to be consumed by His presence &#x2014; and thus to be emptied of self, to be purified in heart and mind and finally to be overcome and transformed by His love. The ultimate consequence of your 15-day journey with John of the Cross may therefore be the deep mystical union with God that John placed at the center of the Christian life.<br> <br></p><p>Father Constant Tonnelier is chaplain of the Carmel at Laval, France and a student of the Carmelite mystics.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>A History Of World Societies: To 1715</h2><p>Intended for a survey-type, college-level history course, this volume covers the main themes and developments in world history, emphasizing the experiences of ordinary people and integrating coverage of women&#39;s history and the non-Western world.

The first section introduces readers to rhetorical theorists and their principles. These significant contributions to the field of argumentation and debate include Aristotle s views on audiences and the ethical character of an advocate, Burke s dramatistic theory of communication, Brockriede s metaphorical image of arguers, Fisher s narrative paradigm, Mill s guidelines for testing the causal correlation, Perelman and Obrechts-Tyteca s conception of a universal audience, Rokeach s definition of values, and Toulmin s model for developing and analyzing argument claims and his conception of arguments as field dependent. Hollihan and Baaske s discussions of these ideas and their applications are easy to follow, unencumbered by technical jargon, and illustrated with engaging examples drawn from current and well-known historical events. The key to the success of this text is the authors superb ability to show readers how foundational principles of argumentation are used in a variety of real-world situations.

James Gilligan has discovered a devastating truth that has been "hiding in plain sight" for the past century - namely, that when America's conservative party, the Republicans, have gained the presidency, the country has repeatedly suffered from epidemics of violent death. Rates of both suicide and homicide have sky-rocketed. The reasons are all too obvious: rates of every form of social and economic distress, inequality and loss - unemployment, recessions, poverty, bankruptcy, homelessness also ballooned to epidemic proportions. When that has happened, those in the population who were most vulnerable have "snapped", with tragic consequences for everyone.</p> <p>These epidemics of lethal violence have then remained at epidemic levels until the more liberal party, the Democrats, regained the White House and dramatically reduced the amount of deadly violence by diminishing the magnitude of the economic distress that had been causing it.</p> <p>This pattern has been documented since 1900, when the US government first began compiling vital statistics on a yearly basis, and yet it has not been noticed by anyone until now except with regard to suicide in the UK and Australia, where a similar pattern has been described.<br> <br>This book is a path-breaking account of a phenomenon that has implications for every country that presumes to call itself democratic, civilized and humane, and for all those citizens, voters and political thinkers who would like to help their country move in that direction.</p></p><p><b>James Gilligan </b>is collegiate professor and MD at New York University.<br>"A quirky book that deserves to be taken seriously ...

This book quantifies the loss due to lack of quality of a performance characteristic by directly relating it to lack of its deviation from target performance, and shows efficient experimental and analytical techniques to minimize it. Unlike other books on quality and industrial experimentation which treat the subject specialty in a localized manner, this book encompasses all major activities of an industry, and links them together with a common objective of reducing quality loss. Chapters of the book progress smoothly and build upon the previous chapters. Each chapter introduces the subject matter, then a real life case study follows and ends with question and answer session between Dr. Raguchi and the student in a typical class. The techniques shown are powerful but easy to apply, and does not require statistical background or other prerequisites; thus, the subject can be taught to engineers in an industry or in engineering schools.&#34;</p><p>Text: English, Japanese (translation)</p><h2>The Essential Erasmus</h2><p>In his own day a center of controversy, in the four hundred years since his death known too often solely as an apostle of mockery and irreverence, Erasmus can be seen today in a new light&#x2014;as a humanist whose concen is at once contemporary and Christian.<p><b>The Essential Erasmus</b> is the first single volume in English to show the full spectrum of this Renaissance man's thought, which is no less profound because it is expressed with the grace, wit, and ironic detachment only a great writer can achieve.</p><p>Contains the full text of <b>In Praise of Folly</b></p><p></p></p><p><b>Desiderius Erasmus</b>&nbsp;(1469&#x2013;1536) was the greatest scholar of the northern Renaissance, the first editor of the&nbsp;New Testament, and an important figure in classical literature.&nbsp;He helped lay the groundwork for the historical-critical study of the past, and his educational writings contributed to the replacement of the older scholastic curriculum by the new humanist emphasis on the classics.

Behind the notorious inconsistencies in the way the Japanese language has come to pronounce the characters it received from China lie several coherent patterns. Identifying these patterns and arranging them in logical order can reduce dramatically the amount of time spent in the brute memorization of sounds unrelated to written forms.<br><br>Many of the &#x201c;primitive elements,&#x201d; or building blocks, used in the drawing of the characters also serve to indicate the &#x201c;Chinese reading&#x201d; that particular kanji use, chiefly in compound terms. By learning one of the kanji that uses such a &#x201c;signal primitive,&#x201d; one can learn the entire group at the same time. In this way, <i>Remembering the Kanji 2</i> lays out the varieties of phonetic pattern and offers helpful hints for learning readings, that might otherwise appear completely random, in an efficient and rational way. Individual frames cross-reference the kanji to alternate readings and to the frame in volume 1 in which the meaning and writing of the kanji was first introduced.<br><br>A parallel system of pronouncing the kanji, their &#x201c;Japanese readings,&#x201d; uses native Japanese words assigned to particular Chinese characters. Although these are more easily learned because of the association of the meaning to a single word, the author creates a kind of phonetic alphabet of single syllable words, each connected to a simple Japanese word, and shows how they can be combined to help memorize particularly troublesome vocabulary.<br><br>The 4th edition has been updated to include the 196 new kanji approved by the government in 2010 as &#x201c;general-use&#x201d; kanji.</p></p><p><b>James W.

It allows students and professionals to acquire the fundamental tools needed to design intelligent, cost-effective, and appropriate solutions to file structure problems. The book begins by presenting the software and hardware characteristics that combine to make file structure design important to application development. It continues with a thorough treatment of the tools that support effective use of files for storing and retrieving information. This book teaches design by putting the hands-on work of constructing and running programs at the center of the learning process. By following the many programming examples included in the book and in the exercise sets, readers will gain a significant understanding of object-oriented techniques and will see how C++ can be an effective software development tool.</p><p><p> The first and second editions of File Structures by Michael Folk and Bill Zoellick established a standard for teaching and learning about file structures. The authors helped many students and computing professionals gain familiarity with the tools used to organize files. </p><p> This book extends the presentation of file structure design that has been so successful for twelve years with an object-oriented approach to implementing file structures using C++. It demonstrates how the object-oriented approach can be successfully applied to complex implementation problems. It is intended for students in computing classes who have had at least one programming course and for computing professionals who want to improve their skills in using files. </p><p> This book shows you how to design and implement efficient file structures that are easy for application programmers to use. All you need is a compiler for C++ or other object-oriented programming language and an operating system. This book provides the conceptual tools that enable you to think through alternative file structure designs that apply to the task at hand. It also develops the programming skills necessary to produce quality implementations. </p><p> The coverage of the C++ language in this book is suitable for readers with a basic knowledge of the language. Readers who have a working familiarity with C++ should have no problem understanding the programming examples. Those who have not programmed in C++ will benefit from access to an introductory textbook. </p><p> The first programming examples in the book use very simple C++ classes to develop implementations of fundamental file structure tools. One by one, advanced features of C++ appear in the context of implementations of more complex file structure tools. Each feature is fully explained when it is introduced. Readers gain familiarity with inheritance, overloading, virtual methods, and templates and see examples of why these features are so useful to object-oriented programming. Organization of the Book </p><p> The first six chapters of this book give you the tools to design and implement simple file structures from the ground up: simple I/O, methods for transferring objects between memory and files, sequential and direct access, and the characteristics of secondary storage. The last six chapters build on this foundation and introduce you to the most important high-level file structure tools, including indexing, cosequential processing, B-trees, B+ trees, hashing, and extendible hashing. </p><p> The book includes extensive discussion of the object-oriented approach to representing information and algorithms and the features of C++ that support this approach. Each of the topics in the text is accompanied by object-oriented representations. The full C++ class definitions and code are included as appendices and are available on the Internet. This code has been developed and tested using Microsoft Visual C++ and the Gnu C++ compilers on a variety of operating systems including Windows 95, Windows NT, Linux, Sun Solaris, and IBM AIX. Object-Oriented File Structures </p><p> There are two reasons we have added the strong object-oriented programming component to this book. First, it allows us to be more specific, and more helpful, in illustrating the tools of file structure design. For each tool, we give very specific algorithms and explain the options that are available to implementers. We are also able to build full implementations of complex file structure tools that are suitable for solving file design problems. By the time we get to B-tree indexing, for instance, we are able to use previous tools for defining object types, moving data between memory and files, and simple indexing. This makes it possible for the B-tree classes to have simple implementations and for the book to explain the features of B-trees as enhancements of previous tools. </p><p> The second purpose of the programming component of the book is to illustrate the proper use of object-oriented methods. Students are often exposed to object-oriented techniques through simple examples. However, it is only in complex systems that the advantages of object-oriented techniques become clear. In this book, we have taken advantage of the orderly presentation of file structure tools to build a complex software system as a sequence of relatively simple design and implementation steps. Through this approach, students get specific examples of the advantages of object-oriented methods and are able to improve their own programming skills. A Progressive Presentation of C++ </p><p> We cover the principles of design and implementation in a progressive fashion. Simple concepts come first and form the foundation for more complex concepts. Simple classes are designed and implemented in the early chapters, then are used extensively for the implementation topics of the later chapters. The most complex file structure tools have simple implementations because they extend the solid foundation of the early chapters. </p><p> We also present the features of C++ and the techniques of object-oriented programming in a progressive fashion. The use of C++ begins with the simplest class definitions. Next comes the use of stream classes for input and output. Further examples introduce inheritance, then virtual functions, and finally templates. </p><p> Each new feature is introduced and explained in the context of a useful file structure application. Readers see how to apply object-oriented techniques to programming problems and learn firsthand how object-oriented techniques can make complex programming tasks simpler. Exercises and Programming Problems </p><p> The book includes a wealth of new analytical and programming exercises. The programming exercises include extensions and enhancements to the file structure tools and the application of those tools. The tools in the book are working software, but some operations have been left as programming problems. The deletion of records from files, for instance, is discussed in the text but not implemented. Specific programming problems fill in the gaps in the implementations and investigate some of the alternatives that are presented in the text. </p><p> An application of information processing is included as a series of programming projects in the exercise sets of appropriate chapters. This application begins in Chapter 1 with the representation of students and courses registrations as objects of C++ classes. In Chapter 2, the project asks for simple input and output of these objects. Later projects include implementing files of objects (Chapter 4), indexes to files (Chapter 7), grade reports and transcripts (Chapter 8), B-tree indexes (Chapter 9), and hashed indexes (Chapter 12). Using the Book as a College Text </p><p> The first two editions of File Structures have been used extensively as a text in many colleges and universities. Because the book is quite readable, students typically are expected to read the entire book over the course of a semester. The text covers the basics; class lectures can expand and supplement the material. The professor is free to explore more complex topics and applications, relying on the text to supply the fundamentals. </p><p> A word of caution: It is easy to spend too much time on the low-level issues presented in the first seven chapters. Move quickly through this material. The relatively large number of pages devoted to these matters is not a reflection of the percentage of the course that should be spent on them. The intent is to provide thorough coverage in the text so the instructor can assign these chapters as background reading, saving precious lecture time for more important topics. </p><p> It is important to get students involved in the development of file processing software early in the course. Instructors may choose some combination of file tool implementation problems from the programming exercises and applications of the tools from the programming projects. Each of the programming problems and projects included in the exercises is intended to be of short duration with specific deliverables. Students can be assigned programming problems of one to three weeks in duration. It is typical for one assignment to depend on previous assignments. By conducting a sequence of related software developments, the students finish the semester with extensive experience in object-oriented software development. A Book for Computing Professionals </p><p> We wrote and revised this book with our professional colleagues in mind. The style is conversational; the intent is to provide a book that you can read over a number of evenings, coming away with a good sense of how to approach file structure design problems. Some computing professionals may choose to skip the extensive programming examples and concentrate on the conceptual tools of file structure design. Others may want to use the C++ class definitions and code as the basis for their own implementations of file structure tools. </p><p> If you are already familiar with basic file structure design concepts and programming in C++, skim through the first six chapters and begin reading about indexing in Chapter 7. Subsequent chapters introduce you to cosequential processing, B-trees, B+ trees, hashing, and extendible hashing. These are key tools for any practicing programmer who is building file structures. We have tried to present them in a way that is both thorough and readable. </p><p> The object-oriented C++ design and the implementation included throughout the book provide an extensive tour of the capabilities of the language and thorough examples of object-oriented design. If you need to build and access file structures similar to the ones in the text, you can use the C++ code as class libraries that you can adapt to your needs. A careful reading of the design and implementation examples can be helpful in enhancing your skills with object-oriented tools. All of the code included in the book is available on the Internet. </p><p> If you are not already a serious Unix user, the Unix material in the first eight chapters will give you a feel for why Unix is a powerful environment in which to work with files. Supplementary Materials </p><p> The following supplementary materials are available to assist instructors and students. </p><p> An Instructors' Guide including answers to exercises will be available. Instructors should contact their Addison-Wesley local sales representative for information on the Guide's availability. Programming examples and code will also be available via anonymous ftp at ftp.aw/cseng/authors/riccardi.

They want to guide their children through the rough spots in life and help them make the right decisions. Research shows that a special parental connection is extremely important in safeguarding children against dangers such as substance abuse, sexual promiscuity, criminal activity, and suicide. This is more important than ever before in today's troubled world. But what does making this connection mean? Based on Bowen family systems theory, Connecting with Our Children shows parents how to build the connection found in better relationships. Now parents have a new way to think about and respond to family problems. The author examines common concerns, such as:<br>* How substance abuse can repeat through generations<br>* Why fusions between family members drive conflict<br>* How family anxiety can erupt into violence<br>* Whether stepfamilies can create a new family unit<br>* What roles faith and humor play in a family<br>* How effective are special contributions made by connections with grandparents<br>Numerous practical examples and stories illustrate familiar situations and concerns, so that parents can learn how to deal with the often confusing situations surrounding their children, as well as those within their own lives. With a different perspective, parents can learn to overcome these difficulties, creating a stronger family and a happier, more open relationship between parent and child.</p><p>ROBERTA M.

Incited by sensational newspaper stories and the growing public hysteria over allegations of widespread Mexican American juvenile crime, scores of American servicemen, joined by civilians and even police officers, roamed the streets of the city in search of young Mexican American men and boys wearing a distinctive style of dress called a Zoot Suit. Once found, the Zoot Suiters were stripped of their clothes, beaten, and left in the street. Over 600 Mexican American youths were arrested. The riots threw a harsh light upon the deteriorating relationship between the Los Angeles Mexican American community and the Los Angeles Police Department in the 1940s.<br><br>In this study, Edward J. Escobar examines the history of the relationship between the Los Angeles Police Department and the Mexican American community from the turn of the century to the era of the Zoot Suit Riots. Escobar shows the changes in the way police viewed Mexican Americans, increasingly characterizing them as a criminal element, and the corresponding assumption on the part of Mexican Americans that the police were a threat to their community. The broader implications of this relationship are, as Escobar demonstrates, the significance of the role of the police in suppressing labor unrest, the growing connection between ideas about race and criminality, changing public perceptions about Mexican Americans, and the rise of Mexican American political activism.</p><p>IN JUNE 1943, THE CITY OF LOS ANGELES was wrenched by the worst rioting it had seen to that point in the twentieth century. Incited by sensational newspaper stories and public hysteria over allegations of widespread crime among Mexican American juveniles, scores of American servicemen, joined by civilians and even police officers, roamed the streets of the city in search of young Mexican Americans wearing zoot suits -- outlandish suits featuring baggy pants with narrow cuffs and knee-length jackets with wide lapels. Once found, zoot suiters were stripped of their clothes and beaten while police stood by. Only a handful of servicemen were arrested, but over six hundred Mexican American youths were incarcerated for disturbing the peace. The riots threw a harsh light on the deteriorating relationship between the city's Mexican American community and the Los Angeles Police Department.<p>In this study, Edward J. Escobar examines the history of the LAPD and the Chicano community from the turn of the century, when the police first became a professional organization, to the era of the Zoot Suit riots. Escobar shows how police increasingly characterized Chicanos as a criminal element, and how the assumption of Mexican Americans that the police were deliberately targeting them grew. As Escobar demonstrates, this troubled relationship prompted Mexican Americans to forge a new political identity, even as the LAPD used fear of minority crime to increase its autonomy. This combination of a politicized minority and an intransigent police force would eventually contribute to other uprisings in Los Angeles, including the 1965 Watts riots and the violence that erupted in 1992 following the acquittal ofLAPD officers accused of beating Rodney King.</p><b>Edward J.

This groundbreaking volume presents an interpersonal approach that will enable therapists of all theoretical orientations to increase their effectiveness and reduce their frustration in working with this very difficult population.<br>The book opens with an introduction to the interpersonal approach and to the Structural Analysis of Social Behavior (SASB) developed by Dr. Benjamin. This dimensional model of interpersonal and intrapsychic interactions can be used to assess patients, their families, and their therapists to determine the specific ways in which they interact with and influence one another. In the sections that follow, each of the DSM personality disorders is sharply delineated in a finely tuned description that is greatly enhanced by Dr. Benjamin's interpersonal approach and clinical insights. Adding an extensive and clinically useful list of descriptive amendments to the DSM criteria, she provides a sophisticated differential diagnosis that greatly reduces the problem of overlap in symptoms that frequently occurs when using the DSM rules alone. Expected transference reactions, developmental histories, and probable underlying motivations are also explored in detail.<br>Throughout, the volume is rich with clinical material that specifically illustrates the interviewing method, the diagnostic process, and treatment interventions. Dr. Benjamin also presents hypotheses concerning the development of crucial interpersonal relationships which may explain the patient's current behavior. Such understanding provides perhaps the most valuable clues on how best to interact with and treat these patients.<br>A major breakthrough in the treatment of personality disorders, this important work will be an invaluable resource for all clinicians - behavioral, psychodynamic, and eclectic - working with this challenging population. It also offers researchers a method to dissect and study more objectively vitally important problems in psychosocial diagnosis and treatment. This volume will serve as an excellent text for psychiatric residencies and graduate courses in psychopathology, personality and personality disorders, psychotherapy, and assessment and diagnosis.</p><p>Lorna Smith Benjamin is at the University of Utah in the Department of Psychology.I.

After a brief stint as a Confederate cavalry militiaman, he joined his brother Orion Clemens, who had been appointed Secretary of the Nevada Territory, on a stagecoach journey west. Twain consulted his brother's diary to refresh his memory and borrowed heavily from his active imagination for many stories in the novel. Roughing It illustrates many of Twain's early adventures, including a visit to Salt Lake City, gold and silver prospecting, real-estate speculation, and his beginnings as a writer. In this memoir, readers can see examples of Twain's rough-hewn humor, which would become a staple of his writing in his later books, such as Adventures of Huckleberry Finn, The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, and A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court. (Source: Wikipedia)</p><p><b>Samuel Langhorne Clemens</b> (November 30, 1835 &#x2013; April 21, 1910),[1] better known by his pen name <b>Mark Twain</b>, was an American author and humorist. Among his writings are The Adventures of Tom Sawyer (1876) and its sequel, Adventures of Huckleberry Finn (1885),[2] the latter often called "The Great American Novel". <br> <br> Twain was raised in Hannibal, Missouri, which later provided the setting for Tom Sawyer and Huckleberry Finn. After an apprenticeship with a printer, Twain worked as a typesetter and contributed articles to the newspaper of his older brother, Orion Clemens. <br> <br> Twain moved to San Francisco in 1864, still as a journalist, and met writers such as Bret Harte and Artemus Ward. The young poet Ina Coolbrith may have romanced him. <br> <br> Twain was fascinated with science and scientific inquiry. He developed a close and lasting friendship with Nikola Tesla, and the two spent much time together in Tesla's laboratory. <br> <br> Twain patented three inventions, including an "Improvement in Adjustable and Detachable Straps for Garments" (to replace suspenders) and a history trivia game.[35][36] Most commercially successful was a self-pasting scrapbook; a dried adhesive on the pages needed only to be moistened before use.[35] Over 25,000 were sold.[ <br> <br> Twain's novel <i>A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court (1889)</i> features a time traveler from the contemporary US, using his knowledge of science to introduce modern technology to Arthurian England. This type of storyline would later become a common feature of a science fiction subgenre, alternate history. <br> <br> In 1909, Thomas Edison visited Twain at his home in Redding, Connecticut and filmed him. Part of the footage was used in The Prince and the Pauper (1909), a two-reel short film. It is said to have been the only known existing film footage of Twain.</p><h2>Teaching Children to Care: Management in the Responsive Classroom</h2><p><p></p><br><strong>NOTE: This edition is out of print and was replaced by a second edition in 2002, ISBN 978-1892989086, $32.</strong><p></p><p>This remarkable book speaks to the heart of every classroom teacher offering a proven, practical approach that can help reduce the exhausting and often overwhelming classroom management problems confronting today's K-8 teachers.</p></p><p>Please keep everything the same in your listing of this book &#34;Teaching Children to Care: Management in the Responsive Classroom,&#34; except for the price: the list price is not $22.18 but $23.50. Thank you!!!!How to introduce the practice of caring into classrooms. This book is about teaching children to care. It draws on my many years as a teacher in inner-city schools and, more recently, in an independent school which was founded in order to apply a developmental point of view. The most important thing I have learned is that discipline is a subject to be taught, just as reading or arithmetic is taught. It is taught year after year without apology. It is taught with the conviction and affirmation of the teacher. We need to approach the issues of classroom management and discipline as much more than what to do when children break rules and misbehave. Rather than simply reacting to problems, we need to establish an ongoing curriculum in self-control, social participation and human development. I have grown to appreciate the task of helping children learn to take better care of themselves, each other and their classrooms. It&#39;s not a waste. It&#39;s probably the most enduring thing that I teach. I hope you enjoy the book and find it useful in your work with children.</p><h2>Tales of Mystery and Imagination (Collins Classics)</h2><p>HarperCollins is proud to present its new range of best-loved, essential classics.</p><p></p><h2>Magic and the Mind: Mechanisms, Functions, and Development of Magical Thinking and Behavior</h2><p>Magical thinking and behavior have traditionally been viewed as immature, misleading alternatives to scientific thought that in children inevitably diminish with age. In adults, these inclinations have been labeled by psychologists largely as superstitions that feed on frustration, uncertainty, and the unpredictable nature of certain human activities.<br> <br>In <em>Magic and the Mind</em>, Eugene Subbotsky provides an overview of the mechanisms and development of magical thinking and beliefs throughout the life span while arguing that the role of this type of thought in human development should be reconsidered. Rather than an impediment to scientific reasoning or a byproduct of cognitive development, in children magical thinking is an important and necessary complement to these processes, enhancing creativity at problem-solving and reinforcing coping strategies, among other benefits. In adults, magical thinking and beliefs perform important functions both for individuals (coping with unsolvable problems and stressful situations) and for society (enabling mass influence and promoting social harmony). Operating in realms not bound by physical causality, such as emotion, relationships, and suggestion, magical thinking is an ongoing, developing psychological mechanism that, Subbotsky argues, is integral in the contexts of politics, commercial advertising, and psychotherapy, and undergirds our construction and understanding of meaning in both mental and physical worlds. <em>Magic and the Mind</em> represents a unique contribution to our understanding of the importance of magical thinking, offering experimental evidence and conclusions never before collected in one source. It will be of interest to students and scholars of developmental psychology, as well as sociologists, anthropologists, and educators.<br></p><p><br>Psychology Department, Lancaster University (UK)<br><br>"In this bold, innovative lifework, Eugene Subbotsky lays the foundation of a cognitive-developmental-cultural science of magic. Based on decades of experimental work, measuring responses to garden-variety magic (magic boxes, wands, incantations and transformations), this book offers a comprehensive review of literature, a radically new theoretical frame, and a detailed developmental account, all with the aim of understanding the irrational, creative and meaningful role of magic in the context of modern life." <br> <br>-Carl N. Johnson, Ph.D., University of Pittsburgh <br><p></p><br>"Subbotsky has managed to integrate extensive research on the development of magical thinking into a coherent argument that ties together work on domain specificity, magical thinking, sympathetic magic, and religion. <em>Magic and the Mind</em> offers a fresh and provocative theoretical perspective." <br> <br>-Margaret Evans, Ph.D., University of Michigan <br><p></p><br>"This is a ground-breaking book on one of human nature's most fascinating quirks: magical thinking. Subbotsky has written a clear and engaging account of his extensive study of this curious aspect of our psychology, seen in both children and adults. His work makes an important contribution." <br> <br>-Stuart Vyse, Ph.D., Connecticut College, author of <em>Believing in Magic: The Psychology of Superstition</em> <br><p></p><br>"In this compelling overview, Eugene Subbotsky shows that magical thinking is not a passing phase of childhood. His ingenious experiments demonstrate that it is a foundational and enduring mode of thought--even if, as adults, we profess scientific rationality. His book makes a major contribution to ongoing debate about the relationship between religion and science." <br> <br>-Paul Harris, Ph.D., Victor S. Thomas Professor of Education, Harvard University <br><p></p><br>"<em>Magic and the Mind</em> constitutes an extremely important contribution to our understanding of magic. [...] Subbotsky's work stands as an important challenge to this tradition [of rational thinking], one that should help us develop a more eclectic approach to human knowledge that accepts its heuristic nature and embraces its many sources and forms." --Edward Bever, <em>Project Muse</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Anthony's Textbook of Anatomy &amp; Physiology</h2><p><p>For years, <b>Anthony's Textbook of Anatomy &amp; Physiology</b> has been known for its unbeatable student-friendly writing style and "big picture" approach to A&amp;P.

Roberts extends to the moral life the account of emotions presented in his Emotions: An Essay in Aid of Moral Psychology (2003), that they are &#34;concern-based construals.&#34; In this book the author explains how emotions can be a basis for moral judgments, how they account for the deeper moral identity of actions we perform, how they are constitutive of morally valenced personal relationships like friendship, enmity, collegiality and parenthood, and how both pleasant and unpleasant emotions interact with our personal wellbeing (eudaimonia). He argues that none of these dimensions of emotions&#39; values is reducible to any of the others. He continues by sketching how all of these moral dimensions contribute to emotions&#39; participation, in diverse ways, in our virtues and vices.</p><p>Building on the vivid account of the emotions in his 2003 book on the subject, Robert C.

It includes features on beliefs, traditions, festivals, and practices of the major faiths, and also looks at and discusses the differences within, as well as between, the faiths.</p><p>Elizabeth Breuilly holds a B.A. in language from the University of York in England, and has written extensively on religion. Joanne O'Brien studied comparative religion and ancient Near Eastern religions at the University of Manchester in England, and holds an M.A. degree in theology. She has written a wide range of books that explore both relationships between faiths and between religion and secular society. Martin Palmer studied theology at the University of Cambridge in England, specializing in Chinese and Japanese studies, and holds an M.A. He founded ICOREC, the International Consultancy on Religion, Education &amp; Culture, in 1983. Consultant Editor Martin E. Marty is the foremost authority and writer on religion in North America today. He is the Fairfax M. Cone Professor of the History of Modern Christianity at the University of Chicago.Grade 7 Up?This superb overview of 10 major faiths is divided into three sections: the Abrahamic faiths (Judaism, Christianity, and Islam), the Vedic faiths (Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism), and the other major traditions (Shinto, Taoism, Sikhism, and Baha'i). The history, development, ways of worship, and celebrations are given for each. The material is particularly well arranged in a large, handsome format and lavishly illustrated with useful, full-color photographs, maps, charts, calendars, and drawings, all of which break up the text into readable blocks. Additional information is set apart in colored boxes to catch the eye and vary the presentation of the material. An excellent introduction, a foreword, and an afterword deal with a brief history of religion in general and comment on its probable future. The introduction also includes an outstanding chart that describes the traditions, holy places, and Scriptures of each major faith, all presented side by side for quick comparison. The writing is scholarly, lucid, and nonpartisan. There are a number of good books, many of which discuss a greater number of faiths, in this area, including Anita Ganeri's Religions Explained (Holt, 1997), Myrtle Langley's Religion (Knopf, 1996), Betsy Maestro's The Story of Religion (Clarion, 1996), William McElrath's Ways We Worship (Barron's, 1997), Lisa Sita's Worlds of Belief (Blackbirch, 1995), and Lynn Underwood's Religions of the World (Gareth Stevens, 1992; o.p.).

In this finely crafted text, Bloom offers instruction in how to read a poem, using his theory that patterns of imagery in poems represent both a response to and a defense against the influence of precursor poems. Influence, as Bloom conceives it, means that there are no texts, but only relationships between texts. Bloom discusses British and American poets including Milton, Wordsworth, Shelley, Keats, Tennyson, Browning, Whitman, Dickinson, Stevens, Warren, Ammons and Ashbery. A full-scale reading of one poem, Browning's "Childe Roland to the Dark Tower Came," represents this struggle between one poet and his precursors, the poem serving as a map for readers through the many versions of influence from Milton to modern poets.<br><br>For the first time, in a new preface, Bloom will consider the map of misreading drawn by contemporary poets such as Ann Carson and Henri Cole. Bloom's new exploration of contemporary poetry over the last twenty years will illuminate how modern texts relate to previous texts, and contribute to the literary legacy of their predecessors.<br></p><p><br><strong>Harold Bloom</strong> is Sterling Professor of Humanities at Yale University, Berg Professor of English at New York University, author of more than twenty books including <em>The Anxiety of Influence, The Western Canon, Shakespeare: The Invention of the Human, The Book of J</em>, and the forthcoming <em>Genius</em>.<br><br>"The sincerity of this book...the sheer care for poetry which governs both this work and its predecessor, is unmistakable and most impressive."--<em>The New York Review of Books</em><p></p><br>"Bloom is the most rare of critics.

Because of his entirely gripping theoretical passion his readings are almost unparalleled in skill and thematic nuance."--<em>The New York Times Book Review</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Essentials of Mathematics: An Applied Approach</h2><p>As in previous editions, the focus in ESSENTIAL MATHEMATICS with APPLICATIONS remains on the Aufmann Interactive Method (AIM). Students are encouraged to be active participants in the classroom and in their own studies as they work through the How To examples and the paired Examples and You Try It problems. Student engagement is crucial to success. Presenting students with worked examples, and then providing them with the opportunity to immediately solve similar problems, helps them build their confidence and eventually master the concepts. Simplicity is key in the organization of this edition, as in all other editions. All lessons, exercise sets, tests, and supplements are organized around a carefully constructed hierarchy of objectives. Each exercise mirrors a preceding objective, which helps to reinforce key concepts and promote skill building. This clear, objective-based approach allows students to organize their thoughts around the content, and supports instructors as they work to design syllabi, lesson plans, and other administrative documents. New features like Focus on Success, Apply the Concept, and Concept Check add an increased emphasis on study skills and conceptual understanding to strengthen the foundation of student success. The Ninth Edition also features a new design, enhancing the Aufmann Interactive Method and making the pages easier for both students and instructors to follow.

His strong and clearly articulated argument establishes that the Bible contains a unanimous witness defining same-sex intercourse as sin. He does so while rigorously engaging biblical scholars and historians who have written both for and against this understanding of same-sex intercourse. In addition, he demonstrates systematically why attempts to classify as irrelevant for our contemporary context the Bible&#39;s rejection of same-sex intercourse fail to do justice to the biblical texts. His conclusions are clear and compassionate, as he cautions readers on all sides of the debate against a truncated gospel, and challenges all to strive for a holistic view of the command to love God and neighbor.&#34;Robert A.

How do we account for the close similarities--and differences--in the Synoptic Gospels? In the last few decades, the standard answers to the typical questions regarding the Synoptic Problem have come under fire, while new approaches have surfaced. This up-to-date introduction articulates and debates the four major views. Following an overview of the issues, leading proponents of each view set forth their positions and respond to each of the other views. A concluding chapter summarizes the discussion and charts a direction for further study.</p><p>In this up-to-date introduction, Craig&nbsp;A. Evans, Mark Goodacre, David Barrett Peabody, and Rainer Riesner articulate and debate the four major views of the Synoptic Problem.<br><br>"Multiple-views books on controversial biblical and theological topics have become quite popular and helpful, especially when each contributor responds to the others.

In a short and unhappy life, he wrote many books and articles on literary, satirical, religious and psychological themes, but the diversity and idiosyncratic style of his writing have contributed to a misunderstanding of his ideas. In this book--the only introduction to the full range of Kierkegaard&#39;s thought--Patrick Gardiner demonstrates how Kierkegaard developed his ideas and examines his thoughts in light of the doctrines on society developed by his contemporaries Marx and Feuerbach.

While still in college, he enlisted in the Army and joined the famous 101st Airborne Division, The Screaming Eagles as a paratrooper and radio operator. After retiring, Koskimaki served as the Executive Secretary of the 101st Airborne Division Association. He was a, teacher, military historian and author of multiple books on United States military operations in the European Theater of World War II, particularly operations carried out by the 101st Airborne Division. He passed in 2016 at the age of 93.Chapter 1 <br>The Marshaling Area<br><br>The training period had come to an end for the Screaming Eagles. The rumor mills had been busy for weeks grinding out the endless chain of reports concerning the imminence of departure for the marshaling areas. The experiences were not new for the men in that all units had participated in several dress rehearsals culminating with Exercise Eagle during the period of May 11&#x2013;14. The sky troopers had emplaned from the same airfields to which they were now being sent. During the last week of May, orders were received restricting the men to their unit areas. They packed their personal belongings, were assigned parachutes, refitted with some new equipment, and packed their equipment bundles.<br><br>Lieutenant Richard Winters served as executive officer of his unit on D-Day. He wrote:1 &#x201c;Leaving Aldbourne was a tough job. A fellow couldn&#x2019;t say a thing to anybody due to security. The English knew we were pushing off. When I went to say good-bye, as if I was off for another maneuver, it got me to see them cry and take it as they did.&#x201d;<br><br>Technician 5th Grade Bill Finn, a D-Day communications wireman said, &#x201c;When we were leaving the company area for the marshaling area, most of the people living in the homes surrounding Donnington Castle were out in the street to wave good-bye to us and wish us luck. They probably didn&#x2019;t know the day we would leave England but they sure knew we wouldn&#x2019;t be back for some time.&#x201d;<br><br>An intelligence soldier, PFC Richard M. Ladd wrote, &#x201c;Regimental Headquarters Company of the 502nd Parachute Infantry Regiment was loaded aboard British buses May 30, 1944, at Chilton-Foliat, Berkshire, England, and driven perhaps 15 miles to Greenham Common Airdrome, where we were quartered until the evening of June 5 in a tent city. The area was enclosed with barbed wire and termed a marshaling area. No one, other than a few high ranking officers, was ever allowed to leave this area until the evening of June 5, when we boarded C-47&#x2019;s for France.&#x201d; Corroborating that statement, Sergeant Louis Truax said, &#x201c;Our marshaling area was near Exeter, England, and was surrounded by barbed wire and guarded by army troops not of our division. They had machine guns at the corners of the area and we were forbidden to talk to the guards.&#x201d;<br><br>Captain Charles O. Van Gorder was a member of the 3rd Auxiliary Surgical Group and had volunteered for the assignment to go in on D-Day with the 101st Airborne Division. His group had previously participated in the campaigns in North Africa, Sicily, and Italy prior to arriving in England. The detached service with the 101st Division was in the form of an experiment to find out if it would be any advantage to take a surgical team in where the casualties were, rather than to take the casualties back to where the evacuation hospitals were located.<br><br>The eight men who volunteered for this mission called themselves the 1st Airborne Surgical Team and they were attached to the 326th Airborne Medical Company. Van Gorder provided his recollections of the marshaling area with these comments: &#x201c;Several days before D-Day, we were sent with part of the 101st Airborne Division to Aldermaston Air Field for staging and briefing. These were very trying days to remain crowded in a large hangar, going out in only small groups at intervals for chow. Latrines were in or somewhere under the roof of the hangars. Keeping us in the hangar and going out in small groups was to frustrate any enemy aerial reconnaissance.&#x201d;<br><br>An enlisted man who was in the same area was PFC George S. Schulist, who was a jeep driver for his platoon leader. His memories of the same staging area include these items: &#x201c;When we went to eat at the mess hall, we were always taken in groups, such as Battery A or Battery B. When we left the hangar, we had to pass the fence gates. Plainclothesmen were waiting on the other side of the gate to escort us to the mess hall. They were there so we could not talk to anyone outside of our groups at the marshaling area.&#x201d;<br><br>The primary reason for placing the men in solitude much like imprisoned men was the briefing for the invasion. With firsthand knowledge of the D-Day targets and objectives, the men were kept isolated to prevent any leaks to the enemy. Some of the men who prepared the briefing aids have good descriptions of these preparations.<br><br>PFC Richard M. Ladd of the 502nd intelligence group described, &#x201c;Regimental S-2 Section was one of the few groups that actually had duties to perform while in the marshaling area. This consisted of building crude tables with wooden sides. Sand was then shoveled into these boxes from some trucks that were driven in. From these crude beginnings, we began our sand tables which were located in each battalion area. On these were developed models from soap and other suitable materials to simulate houses, churches, etc., with paints and some coloring to simulate the general reliefs of the area in Normandy in which we were to jump. Each table was a bit different, in that, it contained different roads and hamlets peculiar to each battalion&#x2019;s S-2 Section. We constructed these sand tables as accurately as we could from the latest aerial serial photographs supplied to us by the Air Force, to coordinate and orient them with wonderfully accurate British defense maps, as well as all the latest information supplied to us by various intelligence agencies, including the latest up-to-date &#x2018;poop&#x2019; from the French underground Maquis.&#x201d;<br><br>Ladd added, &#x201c;After these tables were prepared and the various companies were broken down into platoons, the leaders and sergeants would be briefed in front of the tables as to their objectives, the terrain, directions of the roads, and a general familiarization of their target areas. Each unit would retire to tents and company streets to study maps that had been disseminated to them, and proceed to discuss, argue, and speculate the assigned squads and personnel for specific jobs to be accomplished. Then various trips were made back to the sand tables for restudy by the officers and noncoms.&#x201d;<br><br>A former member of the regimental demolitions section, Corporal Vinnie Utz, had been transferred to the intelligence section of the 506th Regiment for the Normandy operation. He recalled, &#x201c;The S-2 Section made the sand tables for the invasion and we assisted the officers in going over the objectives, company by company. I was put into a complete German uniform by Colonel Robert Sink and told to visit all the line company tents so they could get a good idea of what a Kraut looked like.&#x201d;<br><br>An assistant operations officer for the 377th Parachute Field Artillery Battalion, Captain William E. Brubaker, stated, &#x201c;I recall my part (and the entire S-3 Section) in preparing for the mission. We had plotted the location for the three firing batteries and spent several days in planning targets and computing the firing data for each target. The balance of our time was spent in briefing the rest of the battalion from sand tables and maps. I remember receiving very fine aerial pictures on a daily basis showing our main targets and objectives, and how delighted I was when we discovered that the Air Force had practically eliminated one of the coastal batteries we were to take.&#x201d;<br><br>Recollections of the detailed map reading provides some interesting information. Engineer Lieutenant Harold Young said, &#x201c;Every officer had maps at a scale of 1:10,000 plus oblique air photos of our landing and target positions. Every G.I. had a map at 1:300,000 of the whole general area. We had our men memorize a section of the map so they could get back if they landed in the wrong place. It was said that every private in a parachute unit knew as much as a colonel in a regular infantry outfit.&#x201d;<br><br>After the intelligence personnel had briefed the regimental and battalion staff officers and their men, the briefings continued down through the company commander, the platoon leader, the squad leader, and down to the last private&#x2014;or almost, as we shall see later.<br><br>The commanding officer of the 501st Regiment&#x2019;s Charley Company, Captain Robert H. Phillips, described the painstaking preparation: &#x201c;Several days were devoted by the unit commanders, of which I was one, studying our assignments and formulating detailed plans for carrying them out. Each individual member was then thoroughly briefed on the detailed plans of his particular unit. Only general information was given as to the missions of the division.<br><br>&#x201c;My company&#x2019;s mission was to seize and secure the road junction south of St. Come-du-Mont, a small village, thus securing a flank of the drop zone (DZ). This position also overlooked the main highway bridge north of Carentan, and later gained the name of &#x2018;Dead Man&#x2019;s Corner.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br><br>A platoon leader with Able Company of the same regiment, Lieutenant Sumpter Blackmon, recalled, &#x201c;The intensive sand table briefing we received and gave to our sergeants and to the other men lasted for about a week. The mission for my platoon was to take and hold the La Barquette Locks on the Douve River about a mile north of Carentan. The remainder of the 1st Battalion was to blow the bridges over the river to the northwest of Carentan.&#x201d;<br><br>Minute details were not forgotten. Sergeant Pat Lindsay, mortarman with the same company, said, &#x201c;I remember the sand table work in which each man knew definitely which job he was to do, even down to the direction in which the foxholes would be dug.&#x201d;<br><br>Part of the briefing included familiarizing the men with the enemy uniforms. Private Robert &#x201c;Lightnin&#x201d; Hayes had this recollection to add: &#x201c;I remember the day we were assembled in a tent for the first time and an officer told us where we were going to jump. He then paused to watch our reactions. There was a sand table near by with a facsimile of the terrain on which we were going to drop. There were two dummies standing near the sand table. One was wearing a German Air Force uniform while the other was dressed in the black uniform of the Armored Corps. I tried on the black beret to see how it would fit me. I didn&#x2019;t realize that a few days later I would meet a German face-to-face wearing one of those caps.&#x201d;<br><br>Reconnaissance photography had been so detailed that individual enemy soldiers appeared in recent pictures taken of the objectives. An airborne engineer, PFC John G. Kutz, whose assignment was to be the preparation for destruction of two wooden bridges northeast of Carentan, was briefed with aerial photos of the bridges. He said, &#x201c;On one photograph you could see a German guard standing against one of the bridges. It seemed he was trying to hide from the low- flying plane.&#x201d; Kutz felt he had already met the enemy!<br><br>Two of the men called to mind that they had not received briefings with the rest. Captain Raymond S. &#x201c;Chappie&#x201d; Hall, Protestant Chaplain of the 502nd Regiment, said, &#x201c;I never had time for the briefings and didn&#x2019;t even know the password when it was given nor was I issued a metal clicker.&#x201d;<br><br>A communications soldier with the 2nd Battalion of the 501st Regiment, T/5 Harry T. Mole, Jr., walked around the tented area and watched the men of Dog, Easy, and Fox Companies getting their equipment ready. He made this observation: &#x201c;I watched them as they repeatedly cleaned their rifles over and over again. I watched these men as they sat on boxes and had their hair cut off Indian fashion. I didn&#x2019;t have mine cut. I watched men in circles intently listening to an officer describe their objectives. Their eyes followed every line scratched in the dirt by a stick attached to the officer who was explaining their mission. The invasion was becoming real now. Training could possibly be called over. This was the time they had trained for. Me? Nobody briefed me. I wandered around the area watching the others learn their objectives. How envious I was of the line company men. They knew what it was all about. They belonged.<br><br>&#x201c;My machine gun platoon and our 81mm Mortar Platoon of Headquarters Company belonged. They were assigned to various line companies and were being briefed by them. Each man in my communications platoon had an assignment except me. I was technically a battalion code clerk, a Technician 5th Grade, a rather unimportant role in an invasion of this magnitude. They also gave me an SCR-536, press-to- talk radio probably because they had one left over. As a code clerk, I had a machine to code and decode messages coming to and going from battalion headquarters. Cloak and dagger, eh! One thing was wrong&#x2014;they never told me what the code was!&#x201d;</p><h2>WORDS THEIR WAY LEVEL E STUDENT NOTEBOOK 2006C</h2><p>Keep students engaged as they practice and apply their skills with these consumable notebooks.

Packer (DPhil, Oxford University) is a member of the board of governors and professor of theology at Regent College.<br><br>Sven Soderlund (retired), Dean of Students, Associate Professor of Biblical Studies, at Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia.Theology and Wisdom J. I. Packer I.What Is Theology? &#39;She&#39;s a rum &#39;un, is nature. Nature is more easier conceived than described.&#39; So declared Charles Dickens&#39;s dreadful creation Mr.Wackford Squeers, schoolmaster, pontificating on the world around him.And an observer today might well feel like saying something similar about theology as it goes on show at gatherings of what is nowadays called &#39;the guild&#39;---the professionals who teach theology in universities, seminaries, and a variety of schools and colleges, along with their pre- and postdoctoral apprentices and the people who write books and articles, edit journals, manage Web sites, and publish CD-ROMs of which theology is the announced theme. Here we confront a &#39;rum &#39;un&#39; indeed. Never before has the world or the church seen anything like the range of views about God and religion that is paraded at these meetings in papers read, discussions mounted, and books set out on publishers&#39; display tables. What account of theology, we ask, will embrace all this? Common ground and agreed method seem to be lacking. Should we then echo Mr. Squeers&#39;s cop-out and say, in effect, that describing and defining theology is currently a task beyond us? Do we adopt this counsel of despair, or what? Eventually I want to argue that true theology is essentially identical with God&#39;s gift of wisdom, but let us start where we are. The first fact to be faced is that during the past two centuries the word theology has been drastically secularized and de-doctrinalized among us.No longer does it signify, as it once did, the analysis and assertion of a dominant churchly orthodoxy. Theology has become simply the voicing and discussing of any and every notion about God and religion--- good and bad, old and new, familiar and strange, conventional and eccentric, true and false---and it is clear that many institutions of the theological trade wish to keep it that way. The idea that the church should somehow oversee the study of theology or that there should be basically one theology for everybody is dismissed as naive ecclesiastical primitivism, not to say atavism; and the concept of heresy is deconstructed as a kind of outdated and sordid power play. Following this path, we reach the four frames of a memorable Peanuts cartoon in which Lucy,with her habitual schoolmarmly pertness, delivers the following speech:&#39;My topic today is the purpose of theology.When discussing theology we must always keep our purpose in mind. Our purpose as students is undeniably selfish. There is nothing better than being in a class where no one knows the answer.&#39; Lucy focuses very well the fundamental frivolity of much theology today. To put it clinically (for it is in truth a pathological development), pluralism ---that is, the acknowledging of plurality as totally right and entirely proper--- has become the popular theological paradigm among the Protestants of what we may call the Old West (North America, Britain, continental Europe, and Australasia). Roman Catholics and Orthodox in their different ways still think of theology as a spelling out of the faith of the church within an essentially biblical frame. But for Protestants generally, theology has come to mean adjusting the faith more or less to the prevalent culture according to each adjuster&#39;s individual ideas, so that doing theology and having a theology of one&#39;s own becomes more important than any of the specific affirmations and denials one makes. These personal theologies are repeatedly redesigned as their creators continue to read and discuss. For such Protestants, the Bible is a historical testament of religion with which to dialogue rather than the abiding testimony of God from which to learn and before which to bow; and the supply of energy for their dialogical engagements and theological experiments with Scripture seems endless. So pluralism is evidently here to stay. This present-day plurality of positions among purveyors of theology can be accounted for in various ways. In North America, at any rate, sociological pressures have had something to do with it. The sequence of events is quite simple and predictable: the academics who are promoted are those who publish; publishers naturally want to sell books; notoriety speeds sales; ergo, new ideas and way-out opinions quickly find their way into print. In turn, this cycle provokes fascinating academic discussions, reminding us of what the late Martyn Lloyd- Jones used to say, namely that discussing religion is always a delightful activity, for it makes us feel good without our needing to do anything except talk. Again, for the best part of a century now, many theology-teaching institutions have employed instructors less for the orthodoxy of their views than for their technical prowess and their penchant for stabbing sleepy minds awake. Moreover, many of these teachers seem to have operated on the assumption that their students&#39; education was best served by challenging whatever confessional, Bible-based certainties were brought into the classroom. This has had the knockon effect of impoverishing churches, for though it is a truism that congregations want to hear their preachers&#39; certainties rather than their doubts, this kind of theological education makes the proclamation of certainties impossible, thus undermining the morale of believers and churches alike. Behind these sociological realities, however, stands a problem that is both convictional and methodological. During the twentieth century, a number of streams of thought converged to produce what we now speak of as the post- Christian mind-set. Among these were philosophical and scientific rationalism&#39;s claim of being the only way to knowledge; evolutionary theory&#39;s attempt to explain everything in progress terms; literary and historical criticism&#39;s challenge to the Bible&#39;s trustworthiness; and positivism&#39;s skepticism about any form of supernaturalism. These ideas stand in startling contrast to the view that they displaced. Up to the seventeenth century, Christians everywhere had assumed,more or less explicitly and clearheadedly, that theology was a true science and indeed the Queen of the Sciences, in the sense of its offering an account of God that determines where the other sciences fit in and how they should be practised. Christians believed that this theology constituted a cognitive apprehension---that is, actual knowledge---of the reality of God in Christ according to the Bible and the church&#39;s creeds and liturgies. By the same token, they also believed that the apprehension was not self-generated but was given by God through the means of grace that he provides in and via the church. They believed, moreover, that this apprehension was marked by three integrated characteristics: that as it was factually instructional, so it was devotionally relational and morally transformational. In other words, knowledge of God is as much communion with him and obedience to him as it is grasping facts about him; and theology---that is, the formulation of this knowledge in orderly speech---is real and authentic only to the extent that it embodies these three elements with biblical accuracy and then expresses them in worship and holy living. This was the intellectual paradigm of the whole Christian world for a millennium and a half. II. Theology Deformed Between the seventeenth and nineteenth centuries, however, under the influence of commanding thinkers in the Cartesian mold, this consensus view was shattered by an epistemological upheaval in the Protestant West. The concept of knowledge was itself secularized and shrunk, with the result that theology (already over-intellectualized in many circles after more than a hundred years of ceaseless debates) was subjectivized, a process that virtually guaranteed the hegemony of pluralism.</p><h2>Safe Patient Handling and Mobility: Interprofessional National Standards</h2><p>Injuries and musculoskeletal disorders (MSDs) are common in nurses and other healthcare workers and are often caused by manually lifting and moving patients. This is more than just an inconvenience; these injuries are often life altering and career ending. ANAs new breakthrough guide will help to prevent injuries and protect nurses and other healthcare workers. The guide contains eight overarching safe patient handling and mobility (SPHM) standards. These national interdisciplinary standards address the responsibilities of the employer or health care organization and those of healthcare workers and ancillary/support staff and are applicable across the care continuum. Following these standards is critical for hospitals and other healthcare organizations in promoting a culture of safety through the development of safe and effective SPHM programs.

Here, Jaegwon Kim presents the most comprehensive and systematic presentation yet of his influential ideas on the mind-body problem. He seeks to determine, after half a century of debate: What kind of (or "how much") physicalism can we lay claim to? He begins by laying out mental causation and consciousness as the two principal challenges to contemporary physicalism. How can minds exercise their causal powers in a physical world? Is a physicalist account of consciousness possible?</p><br><p> The book's starting point is the "supervenience" argument (sometimes called the "exclusion" argument), which Kim reformulates in an extended defense. This argument shows that the contemporary physicalist faces a stark choice between reductionism (the idea that mental phenomena are physically reducible) and epiphenomenalism (the view that mental phenomena are causally impotent). Along the way, Kim presents a novel argument showing that Cartesian substance dualism offers no help with mental causation.</p><br><p> Mind-body reduction, therefore, is required to save mental causation. But are minds physically reducible? Kim argues that all but one type of mental phenomena are reducible, including intentional mental phenomena, such as beliefs and desires. The apparent exceptions are the intrinsic, felt qualities of conscious experiences ("qualia"). Kim argues, however, that certain relational properties of qualia, in particular their similarities and differences, are behaviorally manifest and hence in principle reducible, and that it is these relational properties of qualia that are central to their cognitive roles. The causal efficacy of qualia, therefore, is not entirely lost.</p><br><p> According to Kim, then, while physicalism is not the whole truth, it is the truth near enough.</p></p><p><p>"This is a fine volume that clarifies, defends, and moves beyond the views that Kim presented in <i>Mind in a Physical World</i>.

The nature of the stimulation shapes the connections among neurons that create the neuronal networks necessary for thought and behavior. By changing the cultural environment, each generation shapes the brains of the next. By early adulthood, the neuroplasticity of the brain is greatly reduced, and this leads to a fundamental shift in the relationship between the individual and the environment: during the first part of life, the brain and mind shape themselves to the major recurring features of their environment; by early adulthood, the individual attempts to make the environment conform to the established internal structures of the brain and mind. In Brain and Culture, Bruce Wexler explores the social implications of the close and changing neurobiological relationship between the individual and the environment, with particular attention to the difficulties individuals face in adulthood when the environment changes beyond their ability to maintain the fit between existing internal structure and external reality. These difficulties are evident in bereavement, the meeting of different cultures, the experience of immigrants (in which children of immigrant families are more successful than their parents at the necessary internal transformations), and the phenomenon of interethnic violence. Integrating recent neurobiological research with major experimental findings in cognitive and developmental psychology--with illuminating references to psychoanalysis, literature, anthropology, history, and politics--Wexler presents a wealth of detail to support his arguments. The groundbreaking connections he makes allow for reconceptualization of the effect of cultural change on the brain and provide a new biological base from which to consider such social issues as "culture wars" and ethnic violence.</p></p><p>"Bruce Wexler's Brain and Culture is a major achievement, touching the deepest biological and human issues and framing them in verifiable terms. A very powerful and very important book." -- Oliver Sacks, author of The Man Who Mistook His Wife for a Hat <p>"The emerging field of social neuroscience receives a tremendous boost from the publication of Bruce Wexler's Brain and Culture. The brain, he argues, does not merely dictate how we respond to changes in the environment, but is itself shaped through interaction with the social world. In cogent and convincing writing, Wexler argues that social relations, even culture and ideology, involve a neurobiology that can now be explored through the tools of modern neuroscience. Through psychiatric case studies, historical analysis, experiments with various species, and human neuroimaging, he reveals that distinctions between mind and brain, self and environment, and individual and culture can no longer be understood in traditional ways.

In terms of sheer number of species, they are the most successful of all families of vertebrate animals, and the extent and speed with which they have evolved in some African lakes has made them the darlings of evolutionary biologists. But what truly captivates biologists like George Barlow--not to mention thousands of aquarists the world over--is the complexity of their social lives and their devotion to family (most species of cichlids are monogamous and many pairs share the responsibility of raising offspring). In this wonderful book, Barlow describes the unusually high intelligence of these fishes, their complex mating and parenting rituals, their bizarre feeding and fighting habits, and the unusual adaptations and explosive rate of speciation that have enabled them to proliferate and flourish. A celebration of their diversity, <i>The Cichlid Fishes</i> is also a marvelous exploration of how these unique animals might help resolve the age-old puzzle of how species arise and evolve.</p><p>Confined almost without exception to the southern hemisphere, cichlids are perchlike lake- and river-dwelling fish that have long been an important source of food for humans--and that, in places such as Lake Tanganyika, are so overfished that they are in danger of disappearing. Outside the southern hemisphere, the cichlids, which number unknown thousands of species, are known mostly to tropical-fish enthusiasts through a colorful representative, the freshwater angelfish, though tilapia are increasingly farmed as a food source in Asia and North America. Those tilapia can grow to huge size, writes authority George Barlow, as can other cichlids. "Even an angelfish," he notes, "is apt to grow too large for the home aquarium and to devour tidbits like guppies and neon tetras, to the dismay of the aquarist."<p> In this engaging and often humorous survey of the cichlids, Barlow addresses aspects of the fishes' natural history and behavior, among them their well-known and often advantageous aggressiveness (one species is named for legendary boxer Jack Dempsey), peculiar mating habits, and unusual evolutionary adaptations (among them nearly prehensile internal jaws and the use of vocalizations in displays of hostility and courtship). Barlow also discusses larger issues of speciation, gene flow, and conservation. Detailed yet accessible to general readers, Barlow's book summarizes the work of a distinguished career. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>"The cichlid fishes are a natural treasure, a priceless gift to Darwinists. They are almost too good to be true, and nobody is better qualified to show them to us than George Barlow. But he does more than tell us about his beloved fishes. He makes his fishes tell us about ourselves." --Richard Dawkins, author of The Selfish Gene <p>"A wonderful book. Written with a bubbling enthusiasm that will capture everyone from fish hobbyists to theoretical biologists, it is extraordinarily easy to read, very funny (I laughed out loud throughout), and at the same time manages to convey important contemporary ideas in evolutionary biology in a completely understandable way."--Marian Stamp Dawkins, Professor of Animal Behavior, University of Oxford </p><p>"Can social status really determine sex? At a college fraternity party, are cichlids more dangerous than goldfish? Barlow's wonderful book shows us just how much we can learn from these amazing creatures. It will fascinated students and lay readers alike." --Peter Klopfer, Professor of Zoology, Duke University </p><p>"George Barlow knows his cichlids, and even better, he knows how to convey his enthusiasm for the biology of this remarkable group of animals...Read this fine natural history and you will come to share Barlow's affection for these delightfully diverse fish." --John Alcock, Professor of Biology, Arizona State University</p></p><h2>Exercising Essential Statistics</h2><p>Through the use of critical thinking questions and data-based exercises, Evan Berman and Xiaohu Wang&#x2019;s <strong>Exercising Essential Statistics</strong> helps students apply the techniques described in <em>Essential Statistics for Public Managers and Policy Analysts, Fourth Edition</em>.

It will be useful as a reference for research scientists as well. Starting with the hadron spectrum, the reader becomes familiar with the representations of SU(N). Relativistic quantum field theory is recapitulated, and scattering theory is discussed in the framework of scalar quantum electrodynamics. Then the gauge theory of quarks and gluons is introduced. In the more advanced chapters, perturbative and nonperturbative techniques in state-of-the-art QCD are discussed in great detail.<br>The new third edition has been extensively revised and enlarged to cover all new aspects in Quantum chromodynamics.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: German</p><h2>The Complete Guide to High-End Audio</h2><p>Expanded and revised to cover recent developments, this text should tell you what you need to know to become a better listener and buyer of quality high-fidelity components.

Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.George and Weedon Grossmith were born in London in 1847 and 1852 respectively to a theatrical family who were friends with Henry Irving and Ellen Terry. George became a popular composer and performer of comic songs as well as a successful actor. Weedon trained as a painter at the Slade and the Royal Academy, but soon turned to acting like his brother. The Diary of a Nobody began life as a series of columns the brothers wrote together for Punch which they later expanded into a novel. It was published in 1892, with Weedon&#39;s illustrations, to instant acclaim and has remained in print ever since. George died in 1912, followed by his brother in 1919.</p><h2>Frantz Fanon: A Portrait</h2><p><p>"Fanon was consummately incapable of telling the story of himself. He lived in the immediacy of the moment, with an intensity that embodied everything he evoked. Fanon's discourse pertained to a present tense that was unburdened by its narrative past. The little we knew about his personal life had been gleaned from passing allusions, brief glimpses that vanished as quickly as they appeared.... Fanon had a profound talent for life; he was a man who wanted to be the subject and actor of his own life, and it was for this reason that he was so engaging and disarming&#x2015;so alive."&#x2015;from the Introduction</p><p>Frantz Fanon (1925&#x2013;1961) was born in Martinique, and in 1943 left to fight in Europe with Free French forces. After 1945 he studied medicine and psychiatry in Lyons and began to write. His first analysis of the effects of racism and postcolonialism, Black Skin, White Masks, appeared in 1952 and would become a foundational text for the liberation movements of the 1960s and later for postcolonial studies. In 1952 he moved to Algeria and practiced at the Blida-Joinville psychiatric hospital in French Algeria until 1957. From that year he worked full time for the Algerian independence movement, including a brief appointment as the movement's ambassador in Ghana. </p><p>One of Fanon's few surviving contemporaries, Alice Cherki worked closely with Fanon at the psychiatric hospital in Blida and then later for the Algerian cause in Tunisia. This book is a record of "an epoch, a life, and a body of work often viewed as inadmissible." Cherki offers a unique assessment of Fanon's complex personality, illuminating both his psychiatric practice&#x2015;of which she says, "Fanon possessed a tremendous intuition about the unconscious and a great erudition in psychoanalytic theory"&#x2015;and the sources of his political activism, of his intellectual career as a pivot of the quickly changing world. </p><p>Given the continuing relevance of Fanon's insights into the enduring legacy of colonialism on the psyches of the colonized, this compelling and personal account of his life and work will be required reading for anyone interested in the consequences of empire.</p></p><p>I was happy to read Alice Cherki's portrait of Frantz Fanon. Her book is a joy because it is clear and generous. Cherki has succeeded in giving this intellectual the place he merits in history and space. She is right to insist on the fact that Fanon was never an apologist of violence or a revolutionary, but a 'thinker of violence.'"&#x2014;Tahar Ben Jelloun <p>"I was absolutely engrossed by Alice Cherki's recounting of her collegial relationship with Frantz Fanon. What a powerful portrait it is! We learn that Fanon was an extremely private person, offering little insight into his personal life even to Jean-Paul Sartre, a man he greatly admired. This well-written and at times haunting volume gives us a glimpse into the evolution of a revolutionary. Cherki reassures us that Fanon was indeed a man of conviction and integrity who cared deeply for his patients and espoused a philosophy of human freedom from a tender age."&#x2014;T. Denean Sharpley-Whiting, Vanderbilt University </p><p>"Fanon possessed a spirit that arced between two diodes: action and rejection. That vital arc would burn, over its rectifications, a path of distinct splendor. Alice Cherki guides us&#x2014;rather, she compels us&#x2014;through the currents that forged Fanon's life and the ascendant lucidity of his thought. With the precision of a scholar, the scruple of a psychoanalyst, and the candor of a personal friend, Cherki offers an unprecedented account of a formidable intellect."&#x2014;Patrick Ehlen, author of Frantz Fanon: A Spiritual Biography </p><p>"At a time when Fanon's study of human alienation and anticolonial revolt appears to be taking on a new concreteness, Alice Cherki's book is most welcome. With a freshness not always found in academic studies, Cherki creates a moving portrait that provides a much-needed insight into the man, as well as a rich contextualization for his thinking and activity. Based on her own working relationship with Fanon in the critical period of the Algerian Revolution, Cherki provides perceptive readings of Fanon, as well as of the politics and personalities of the Algerian liberation struggle. Fanon is brought to life in Cherki's sympathetic yet critical book not only as a powerful intellect and complex personality but also as a passionate individual engaged in the radical project of human freedom."&#x2014;Nigel C. Gibson, author of Fanon: The Postcolonial Imagination </p><p>"This is a book that was waiting to be written, and, thanks to Nadia Benabid&#x2019;s excellent translation of these candid reflections of Alice Cherki, a fellow anticolonialist who was also a student, friend, and then colleague of Frantz Fanon, it comes to us with breathtaking grace and poignancy. This is a remarkable, must-read text for anyone interested in the context in which Fanon&#x2019;s brilliant reflections on the psychodynamics of colonialism and racism emerged, and it is of equal interest to anyone interested in how such social diagnoses continue to bear on the present."&#x2014;Lewis Gordon, author of Fanon and the Crisis of European Man and President of the Caribbean Philosophical Association</p><p>Alice Cherki lives in Paris, where she is a practicing psychoanalyst.

It is a strange story, in which many extraordinary things happen, some of them shocking and brutal, some of them pitiful and touching--yet always with elements of comedy and irony and burlesque that appear in unexpected places. It is a book that has a great deal to say and which is destined to have a great deal said about it.<br><br>After a brief prologue, the story begins with a terrifying experience of the hero's high school days, moves quickly to the campus of a Southern Negro college and then to New York's Harlem, where most of the action takes place. The many people that the hero meets in the course of his wanderings are remarkably various, complex and significant. With them he becomes involved in an amazing series of adventures, in which he is sometimes befriended but more often deceived and betrayed--as much by himself and his own illusions as by the duplicity of the blindness of others. <br><br><b>Invisible Man </b>is not only a great triumph of storytelling and characterization; it is a profound and uncompromising interpretation of the Negro's anomalous position in American society.</p><p>We rely, in this world, on the visual aspects of humanity as a means of learning who we are. This, Ralph Ellison argues convincingly, is a dangerous habit. A classic from the moment it first appeared in 1952, <i>Invisible Man</i> chronicles the travels of its narrator, a young, nameless black man, as he moves through the hellish levels of American intolerance and cultural blindness. Searching for a context in which to know himself, he exists in a very peculiar state. "I am an invisible man," he says in his prologue. "When they approach me they see only my surroundings, themselves, or figments of their imagination--indeed, everything and anything except me." But this is hard-won self-knowledge, earned over the course of many years.<p> As the book gets started, the narrator is expelled from his Southern Negro college for inadvertently showing a white trustee the reality of black life in the south, including an incestuous farmer and a rural whorehouse. The college director chastises him: "Why, the dumbest black bastard in the cotton patch knows that the only way to please a white man is to tell him a lie! What kind of an education are you getting around here?" Mystified, the narrator moves north to New York City, where the truth, at least as he perceives it, is dealt another blow when he learns that his former headmaster's recommendation letters are, in fact, letters of condemnation. </p><p> What ensues is a search for what truth actually is, which proves to be supremely elusive. The narrator becomes a spokesman for a mixed-race band of social activists called "The Brotherhood" and believes he is fighting for equality. Once again, he realizes he's been duped into believing what he thought was the truth, when in fact it is only another variation. Of the Brothers, he eventually discerns: "They were blind, bat blind, moving only by the echoed sounds of their voices. And because they were blind they would destroy themselves.... Here I thought they accepted me because they felt that color made no difference, when in reality it made no difference because they didn't see either color or men."</p><p> <i>Invisible Man</i> is certainly a book about race in America, and sadly enough, few of the problems it chronicles have disappeared even now. But Ellison's first novel transcends such a narrow definition. It's also a book about the human race stumbling down the path to identity, challenged and successful to varying degrees. None of us can ever be sure of the truth beyond ourselves, and possibly not even there. The world is a tricky place, and no one knows this better than the invisible man, who leaves us with these chilling, provocative words: "And it is this which frightens me: Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?" <i>--Melanie Rehak</i></p>"The Negro American experience...is indispensable to any profoundly American depiction of reality...This background provides the black writer with much to write about. As fictional material it rivals that of the nineteenth-century Russians."<br>--Ralph Ellison</p><h2>The Tyranny of Guilt: An Essay on Western Masochism</h2><p><p>Fascism, communism, genocide, slavery, racism, imperialism--the West has no shortage of reasons for guilt. And, indeed, since the Holocaust and the end of World War II, Europeans in particular have been consumed by remorse. But Pascal Bruckner argues that guilt has now gone too far. It has become a pathology, and even an obstacle to fighting today's atrocities. Bruckner, one of France's leading writers and public intellectuals, argues that obsessive guilt has obscured important realities. The West has no monopoly on evil, and has destroyed monsters as well as created them--leading in the abolition of slavery, renouncing colonialism, building peaceful and prosperous communities, and establishing rules and institutions that are models for the world. The West should be proud--and ready to defend itself and its values. In this, Europeans should learn from Americans, who still have sufficient self-esteem to act decisively in a world of chaos and violence. Lamenting the vice of anti-Americanism that grips so many European intellectuals, Bruckner urges a renewed transatlantic alliance, and advises Americans not to let recent foreign-policy misadventures sap their own confidence. This is a searing, provocative, and psychologically penetrating account of the crude thought and bad politics that arise from excessive bad conscience.</p></p><p><p>"With eloquence, relish, and confidence, Pascal Bruckner confronts those whose morbid addiction to self-blame has begun to flirt with the suicidal. It's not necessary to concur with him about what constitutes faith or the lack of it. More useful and surprising (and educational) is to compare his authentic quotations from Fanon with the currently received opinion of that author. This is a book that issues a challenge in every chapter, and in some chapters on every page."<b>--Christopher Hitchens</b></p><p>"With controlled anger, Pascal Bruckner scrutinizes European civilization and unsparingly tells the truth, no matter how congenial: Europe is worth admiring and emulating. Its spirit of critical inquiry has produced a culture of tolerance, liberalism, and learning. Its historical sins of omission and commission are legion, yet its values have allowed us to supersede them. In attacking a republican heresy of guilt without accountability, Bruckner chooses the right target and to great effect. This is a bracing call for the universality of republican ideals."<b>--Oliver Kamm, columnist and editorial writer for <i>The Times</i> (London)</b></p><p>"In telling the West not to die of guilt, Pascal Bruckner has laid himself open to attack from all those who think it should. But this essential book, subtly argued and scholarly though it is, has a simple formulation at its heart that would be enough by itself to convey the power of his case: the West didn't invent slavery, the West invented its abolition. His ability to focus light on propositions like that makes him one of the indispensable philosophers of our time."<b>--Clive James, novelist, poet, and essayist</b></p><p>"Bruckner's writing combines wit, learning, and savage indignation. The result is a brilliant defense of liberalism and a deservedly contemptuous assault on all those intellectuals who have betrayed its best values."<b>--Nick Cohen, author of <i>What's Left?: How the Left Lost Its Way</i></b></p><p>"Pascal Bruckner might well be the most distinguished essay writer in France today. He is both inordinately talented and prodigiously politically incorrect. No one better unmasks the pieties of the reigning intellectual cant. Whether one agrees or disagrees with him, he does the life of the mind an invaluable service."<b>--Richard Wolin, author of <i>The Wind from the East</i></b></p><b>Pascal Bruckner</b> is the award-winning author of many books of fiction and nonfiction, including the novel <i>Bitter Moon</i>, which was made into a film by Roman Polanski.

Bored by the eligible bachelors and endless parties of the English aristocracy, she arranges for a horseback trek through the Algerian desert. Two days into her adventure, Diana is kidnapped by the powerful Sheik Ahmed Ben Hassan, who forces her into submission. Diana tries desperately to resist but finds herself falling in love with this dark and handsome stranger. Only when a rival chieftain steals Diana away does the Sheik realize that what he feels for her is more than mere passion. He has been conquered&#x2014;and risks everything to get her back. The power of love reaches across the desert sands, leading to the thrilling and unexpected conclusion.</p><p>One of the most widely read novels of the 1920s, and forever fixed in the popular imagination in the film version starring the irresistible Rudolph Valentino, <i>The Sheik</i> is recognized as the immediate precursor to the modern romance novel. When first published there was nothing like it: To readers the story was scandalous, exotic, and all-consuming; to such critics as the <i>New York Times</i> the book was "shocking," although written with "a high degree of literary skill." In the author's native England, the bestselling book was labeled "poisonously salacious" by the <i>Literary Review</i> and banned from some communities. But the public kept reading.</p><p>The influence of <i>The Sheik</i> on romance writers and readers continues to resonate. Despite controversy over its portrayal of sexual exploitation as a means to love, <i>The Sheik</i> remains a popular classic for its representation of the social order of its time, capturing contemporary attitudes toward colonialism as well as female power and independence that still strike a chord with readers today.</p></p><p>E.

Soon people are sneezing and dying all over Manchester. Telekinetic cop Sybil Jones knows that, like Coyote, they died happy - but even a happy death can be a murder. As exotic blooms begin to flower all over the city, the pollen count is racing towards 2000 and Sybil is running out of time. &#39;As weird as it is wonderful ...surprising in its subtlety and deftness of characterisation&#39;. - &#34;The Times&#34;. &#39;Great fun.

Clarke award), and both are concerned with a world in which dreams, drug-induced hallucination, and reality become completely intermingled. In this volume, the dream world unleashes a pollen that threatens to cause people in the real world to sneeze to death. </p><p> But no review can do Noon's writing justice: it's a phantasmagoric combination of the more imaginative science fiction masters, such as Phillip K. Dick, genres such as cyberpunk and pulp fiction, and drug culture. </p><p> If you would like a more accessible approach to Jeff Noon's richly imagined world, I recommend <i>Automated Alice</i>, a modern recasting of Lewis Carroll's <i> Alice in Wonderland</i>.</p>ing author of Vurt spins another audaciously inventive tales of reality gone soft and dreams become real. As an enormous cloud of pollen descends upon a city, people begin to literally sneeze themselves to death. When a cop, one of the few who is immune, sets out to find the source of the plague, what she discovers will forever alter the ancient relationship between people and the myths they create to make sense of the world.</p><h2>Ring for Jeeves</h2><p>Jeeves is acting as temporary butler to Captain Biggar, big-game hunter and all round tough guy while the young master is away teaching the aristocracy how to fend for itself in case of social revolution.</p><p></p><h2>Ancient North America: The Archaeology of a Continent</h2><p>Provides a narrative account of what is known of the diverse ancient societies of North America, from first settlement before 12,000 BC up to European contact and beyond.

In this critical biography Steven Stucky traces Lutostawski&#39;s development from the Stravinsky-influenced music of his student days to his emergence in the 1960s as a leading avant-gardist. Since the vicissitudes of cultural life in his native Poland have profoundly affected the composer&#39;s career, the book includes detailed accounts of Lutostawski&#39;s official censure for &#39;formalism&#39; in the late 1940s and the leading role he later played in a flourishing Polish modernist movement.

It is the portrait of nineteenth-century Russian society in which a "positively good man" clashes with the emptiness of a society that cannot accomodate his moral idealism. Meticulously faithful to the original, this new translation includes explanatory notes and a critical introduction by W.J. Leatherbarrow.</p><p>&#39;The chief thing is that they all need him&#39; -thus Dostoyevsky described Prince Myshkin, the hero of perhaps his most remarkable novel. As the still, radiant center of a plot whose turbulent action is extraordinary even for Dostoyevsky, Myshkin succeeds in dominating through sheer force a personality a cast of characters who vividly and violently embody the passions and conflicts of the 19th century Russia.Fyodor Mikhailovich Dostoevsky (1821-1881) was a Russian novelist and writer of fiction.</p><h2>Medical Physiology: With STUDENT CONSULT Online Access (MEDICAL PHYSIOLOGY (BORON))</h2><p>The updated 2nd edition of this accessible and in-depth resource firmly relates molecular and cellular biology to the study of human physiology and disease.

Fleeing the East and a heartbreaking past, Morissa Kirk finds the North Platte River Valley rife with rumors of gold strikes. Fortune hunters, desperadoes, horse thieves, murderers make up the frontier society, while Indians roam the plains refusing to surrender their land to the gold-hungry white men. Near lawless Clarke Bridge she sets up her practice, treating white and Indian alike, receiving horses (if anything) in return for her services. Then, even as fame spreads of her skill, and acceptance slowly grows, Morissa becomes embroiled in the life-and-death struggle between the cattlemen and the homesteaders, a struggle as destructive as it was inevitable. In the telling of Morissa's story, Mari Sandoz has caught the whole turmoil of the changing frontier in the days of Custer, Calamity Jane, and Buffalo Bill Cody.</p><p>"Beautifully written and full of striking images and masterful descriptions."&#x2014;<i>New York Times</i> (<i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>"A novel that has everything&#x2014; a plot you won&#x2019;t be able to lay aside."&#x2014;<i>Denver Post</i> (<i>Denver Post</i>)</p><h2>Inside Microsoft� SQL Server� 2008: T-SQL Querying</h2><p><p>Tackle the toughest set-based querying and query tuning problems&#x2014;guided by an author team with in-depth, inside knowledge of T-SQL.

Some of you saw the Amazon page for&nbsp;<i>Core Python Applications Programming&nbsp;</i>with a "3rd edition" tag. I'm sure you'll naturally assume that it's the 3rd ed. of&nbsp;<i>Core Python Programming</i>&nbsp;but may be confused by the name change. To clarify: it is... sort of.<br><br>Two things occurred which led us here: the 1st is a shortage of books on the market to help the intermediate Python developer. What do you do after you've learned Python? You may have read&nbsp;<i>Dive into Python</i>,&nbsp;<i>Beginning Python</i>, or&nbsp;<i>Learning Python</i>, and have written some basic tools/apps but have nowhere to turn other than dive deeply into specific topics w/books about game programming, databases, graphics/multimedia, GUIs, networking, etc.<br><br>If you want more than one skill you'd have to buy a book on every topic. This is overkill, esp. if you're only interested in expanding your skillset. In those cases you're not ready to dive&nbsp;that&nbsp;deep. You'll spend a lot, read a few chapters, then they'll collect dust (unless you're being paid or want to become an expert). This is the exact reason why I wrote "Part II" of&nbsp;<i>Core Python Programming</i>&nbsp;calling it "Advanced Topics". After spending a year (most of 2000) writing what I thought was the entire book, I asked myself, "Wait, I've just taught all these folks Python, but I didn't really show what they could&nbsp;build&nbsp;with it." Part II was written as a result.<br><br>Another thing that happened is that the book grew quite significantly. Originally 810 pages long, it bloomed to 1120 for the 2nd ed. With the new material for the 3rd ed., a massive tome would be difficult &amp; expensive to publish plus would cause an unnecessary burden upon readers (unless getting an electronic edition). Thus I am pleased to announce that those chapters have been extracted to form their own book,&nbsp;<i>Core Python Applications Programming</i>!<br><br>The contents have been cleaned up and retrofitted w/Python 3 examples paired w/their 2.x friends as a hybrid to help you learn both 2.x &amp; 3.x. You'll find that many chapters have new material including: NoSQL/non-relational databases featuring MongoDB, more Microsoft Office� examples using Outlook &amp; PowerPoint (including the text-to-slide generator some of you have seen me use at conferences), interfacing w/Twitter, using Yahoo!Mail &amp; Gmail to send/receive email, and even doing social media analysis w/Google+! There are also brand new chapters on Web framework development using Django, an introduction to cloud computing w/Google App Engine, and text processing w/CSV, JSON, and XML. The purpose is to provide comprehensive intros to but not go deep into any particular topic; please adjust any expectations appropriately. We hope you are as excited about the new book as we are!<br><br>The material making up "Part I" of the original book will take another couple of years to complete due to all the changes coming from Python 3 and not on the horizon at this time, so if you are a programmer completely new to Python, we still recommend the 2nd edition of&nbsp;<i>Core Python Programming</i>&nbsp;as the best place to go learn Python as quickly and as in-depth as possible. You'll get a great preview of&nbsp;<i>Core Python Applications Programming</i>&nbsp;there too! Also I look forward to meeting some of you at an upcoming conference or in one of my training courses!<p><b>Referred to by readers as &#x201c;the greatest language book I have every read,&#x201d; and touted as the best overview of basic principles and strategies for English language teaching, this widely used guide is a one-stop introduction to teaching English to speakers of other languages.</b></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Written in D�az-Rico's passionate style, the third edition of this highly praised introduction to teaching English to speakers of other languages continues to provide a concise, yet comprehensible overview of the basic principles, practices, and methods most effective for educating English learners.

Around 95 percent of all living species died out&#x2015;a global catastrophe far greater than the dinosaurs' demise 185 million years later. How this happened remains a mystery. But there are many competing theories. Some blame huge volcanic eruptions that covered an area as large as the continental United States; others argue for sudden changes in ocean levels and chemistry, including burps of methane gas; and still others cite the impact of an extraterrestrial object, similar to what caused the dinosaurs' extinction.</p><p><i>Extinction</i> is a paleontological mystery story. Here, the world's foremost authority on the subject provides a fascinating overview of the evidence for and against a whole host of hypotheses concerning this cataclysmic event that unfolded at the end of the Permian.</p><p>After setting the scene, Erwin introduces the suite of possible perpetrators and the types of evidence paleontologists seek. He then unveils the actual evidence--moving from China, where much of the best evidence is found; to a look at extinction in the oceans; to the extraordinary fossil animals of the Karoo Desert of South Africa. Erwin reviews the evidence for each of the hypotheses before presenting his own view of what happened.</p><p>Although full recovery took tens of millions of years, this most massive of mass extinctions was a powerful creative force, setting the stage for the development of the world as we know it today.</p><p>In a new preface, Douglas Erwin assesses developments in the field since the book's initial publication.</p></p><p><p>"Douglas Erwin blends careful scholarship and graceful prose in this authoritative elucidation of Earth's greatest mass extinction.

In <i>The Five Roles of a Master Herder</i>, she adapts these horse-inspired insights into useful tools for developing collaborative leadership and managing change.<br><br>Over thousands of years, Kohanov writes, master herders&#x201d; of nomadic herding cultures developed a multifaceted, socially intelligent form of leadership combining the five roles of <b>Dominant</b>, <b>Leader</b>, <b>Sentinel</b>, <b>Nurturer / Companion</b>, and <b>Predator</b>. The fluid interplay of these roles allowed interspecies communities to move across vast landscapes, dealing with predators and changing climates, protecting and nurturing the herd while keeping massive, gregarious, often aggressive animals together without the benefit of fences and with very little reliance on restraints.<br><br>She includes an innovative assessment tool that will help you determine which roles you currently overemphasize and which roles you may be ignoring or even actively avoiding. Through this powerful, at times surprising and moving book, Kohanov will show you how to recognize, cultivate, and utilize all five roles in the modern tribes of your workplace, family, and other social organizations.</p><p>The author of the bestseller <i>The Tao of Equus</i>, <b>Linda Kohanov</b> speaks and teaches internationally. She established Eponaquest Worldwide to explore the healing potential of working with horses and offer programs on everything from emotional and social intelligence, leadership, stress reduction, and parenting to consensus building and mindfulness. She lives near Tucson, Arizona.Linda Kohanov, author of the bestselling The Tao of Equus, pioneered a deep understanding of &#x201c;the way of the horse,&#x201d; including the extraordinary nonverbal communication of skilled riders and the collaborative power of &#x201c;herding cultures&#x201d; through the centuries. She has adapted this profound, time-tested approach to modern life and the organizations in which top-down management hierarchies have become obsolete. Detailing the five roles of &#x201c;master herders&#x201d;&#x2014;Dominant, Leader, Sentinel, Nurturer/Companion, Predator&#x2014;she shows readers how to recognize and utilize them in the &#x201c;modern tribes&#x201d; of our workplaces and other social organizations.

But how is it possible to understand Hitler? <em>Hitler: Diagnosis of Destruction</em> begins to answer that question by providing the first analysis of Hitler's life by a trained MD and practicing psychiatrist. <br> Fritz Redlich, MD, provides a full-length biography of Hitler, focusing especially on his medical and mental history and showing us precisely how Hitler's physical and mental health influenced his beliefs and behavior. Redlich engages a host of fascinating questions. Was there a history of mental illness in Hitler's family? Did he suffer from congenital abnormalities? Did he contract syphilis as a young man? What bizarre role did that disease play in his anti-Semitism? What is the history of Hitler's amphetamine abuse? Did he suffer from Parkinson's disease? Drawing upon medical records of Hitler's World War I injuries andsubsequent illnesses, combined with a penetrating exploration of Hitler's writings, Redlich offers new insight into Hitler's vision of himself as a prophetic leader. The final chapter offers a psychiatric portrait of Hitler, and it is here that Redlich's analysis reveals the highly combustible mixture of denial, projection, sexual repression, paranoid delusion, and narcissistic rage that transformed Hitler from an aimless, friendless, and vaguely resentful youth into the most destructive force of the twentieth century.<br> Complete with illustrations, critical medical reports by Hitler's personal physicians, and a medical glossary, this book brings to light the darkest recesses of one of the world's most impenetrable minds.</p><p>Many theorists in psychology have attempted to understand Adolf Hitler, but no analyst has put the <i>F�hrer</i> on the couch with more throrough results than Fritz Redlich. In <i>Hitler: Diagnosis of a Destructive Prophet</i>, the Yale psychiatrist considers whether physical illness and mental disorder affected the dictator's state of mind. In this matter, Redlich allows no simplistic labels or easy explanations. Keenly aware of the limits that historical sources impose on medical and psychological approaches, he overturns many diagnostic assessments of Hitler, arguing that "precise and subtle description is superior" to often inaccurate generalizations about personality.<p> While there have been hundreds of biographies of Hitler, Redlich's stands out for its extensive use of the <i>F�hrer</i>'s medical records, and an exhaustive survey of the relationship between Hitler and his personal physician, the controversial Theodor Morrel. Redlich also approaches more enduring issues, such as the <i>F�hrer</i>'s sex life, vegetarianism, rumored genital deformity, possible syphilis, Parkinson's disease, and amphetamine addiction with fresh insight. Out of Redlich's absorbing account emerges a mercurial, paranoid fanatic who went to any lengths to maintain his popularity. <i>--James Highfill</i></p><br><strong>Fritz Redlich</strong> was born in Vienna in 1910 and received his medical doctorate from the University of Vienna in 1935.

The mysteries of Eros and Thanatos, the stubborn endurance of mind and body in the face of diminishment--these are the undercurrents of Stephen Dunn's eleventh volume. "I am interested in exploring the 'different' hours," he says, "not only of one's life, but also of the larger historical and philosophical life beyond the personal."</p><p>Stephen Dunn is the author of nineteen poetry collections, including the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning Different Hours, and was a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award and the recipient of an Academy Award for Literature. His poems have appeared in The New Yorker, Atlantic, and American Poetry Review, among many other publications. A distinguished professor emeritus at Richard Stockton University, he lives in Frostburg, Maryland.This sensitive 11th book from Dunn (Loosestrife) largely sticks to familiar territory: in one central poem, a "master" advises the speaker to "Use what's lying around the house./ Make it simple and sad." Dunn follows that advice unwaveringly: his short lyrics in conversational language address the difficulties and small victories of everyday lifeAfears on turning 60, marital quarrels, suburban weather, "the commonplace and its contingencies." Like Gerald Stern and Philip Booth, Dunn strives to describe the travails of ordinary people in language not only simplified but generalized: a friend's divorce leads the speaker to say "no one can know what goes on/ in the pale trappings of bedrooms," while scary headlines and advancing age prompt the remark that "it's tempting to believe/ we lived in simpler times." Poems about places offer few surprises: Italy yields "the chosen gloomy beauty of a tourist town," and a series of poems about Dunn's native South Jersey produce phrases almost as stale. Many poems try so hard for their transparency that they become predictable, so hard to be representative that their speakers seem too normal to be true, even the usually multi-valent Odysseus, who here "sailed through storm and wild sea/ as if his beloved were all that ever mattered." Such mythical alter egos, when they appear, disappear into the dominant mode here, that of a quiet family man who wants to be kind and to marvel at the ordinary, "amazed/ that the paper has been delivered." Fans will pick up this book to get news of his latest doings, but despite its accessibility, it will draw few new subscribers.

Rejecting the dry insider's air of knowing punditry, Leo's conversational style and acerbic wit engage the reader with his insightful and humorous views of what is going on in education, law, advertising, television, the news media, language, and the various liberation movements that are shaping-and sometimes convulsing-the country.</p> <p> The unifying thread of <i>Incorrect Thoughts</i> is the emergence of Political Correctness and its diffusion throughout American social and cultural life. Most of the media have viewed the rise of PC as a collection of unimportant oddball anecdotes, but Leo perceives it as a coherent social movement sweeping through colleges and schools, the courts, the media, the feminist movement, and the art world. Its goals are traditional goals of the left-equality, inclusion, liberation, racial justice-but, as Leo notes, the tactics employed are often less than noble and the contempt for tradition, standards, and Western culture has grown each year.</p> <p> The new orthodoxy has developed a taste for censorship and coercion. Speech codes and anti-harassment policies are used as weapons to silence and intimidate opponents. Speakers have been shouted down and whole editions of college newspapers stolen to keep students from reading the arguments of conservatives and moderates. Readers will find here judicious and often devastating appraisals of self-esteem and therapeutic trends in education, of efforts to revamp history along multicultural lines, and of the extremities and absurdities of identity politics among other of the latest fashions in radical chic.</p> <p> Drawing from ideas first presented in his <i>U.S. News and World Report</i> columns Leo charts the political fever of a contentious and disordered period in American society. At the same time his pointed humor, long-term perspective, and strong moral edge ensures his continuing importance to the debates of our time. This book will interest those who share Leo's concerns as well as those who appreciate models for incisive political commentary.</p></p><p><p> <em>John Leo</em> is editor of the weekly syndicated column "On Society" in <i>U.S. News and World Report</i>.

Applied mathematics has become all-pervasive during the past 100 years as business, technology, and mathematics have combined to generate the computer age and the information society. In episodic fashion, Davis and Hersh present a lively narrative on the background and history of automation technology and its resultant social changes, and they evaluate the effectiveness, benefits, and even dangers of the "mathematization of the world." Fascinating and unique reading, though some of the essays are rather technical for the nonspecialist. Still, highly recommended. Robert Paustian, Wilkes Coll.

From his father, a professor of French history, he acquired a love for studying the past, and he knew from an early age that he too would become a historian. He received his B.A. from Fordham University in 1965 and his Ph.D. from Yale in 1970. In graduate school he became fascinated by the history of the law and the interaction between law and politics, interests that he has maintained throughout his career. In 1969 he joined the history department of the University of Texas at Austin, where he is now the John Green Regents Professor in History. The winner of several teaching awards, Levack teaches a wide variety of courses on British and European history, legal history, and the history of witchcraft. For eight years he served as the chair of his department, a rewarding but challenging assignment that made it difficult for him to devote as much time as he wished to his teaching and scholarship. His books include <i>The Civil Lawyers in England, 1603&#x2014;1641: A Political Study</i> (1973), <i>The Formation of the British State: England, Scotland and the Union, 1603&#x2014;1707</i> (1987), <i>The Witch-Hunt in Early Modern Europe</i> (fourth edition, 2015), and <i>The Devil Within: Possession and Exorcism in the Christian West</i> (2013).<br> <br>His study of the development of beliefs about witchcraft in Europe over the course of many centuries gave him the idea of writing a textbook on Western civilization that would illustrate a broader set of encounters between different cultures, societies, and ideologies. While writing the book, Levack and his two sons built a house on property that he and his wife, Nancy, own in the Texas hill country. He found that the two projects presented similar challenges: It was easy to draw up the design, but far more difficult to execute it. When not teaching, writing, or doing carpentry work, Levack runs along the jogging trails of Austin and has recently discovered the pleasures of scuba diving.<br> <br> <b>Edward Muir</b> grew up in the foothills of the Wasatch Mountains in Utah, close to the Emigration Trail along which wagon trains of Mormon pioneers and California-bound settlers made their way westward. As a child he loved to explore the broken-down wagons and abandoned household goods left at the side of the trail and from that acquired a fascination with the past. Besides the material remains of the past, he grew up with stories of his Mormon pioneer ancestors and an appreciation for how the past continued to influence the present. During the turbulent 1960s, he became interested in Renaissance Italy as a period and place that had been formative for Western civilization. His biggest challenge is finding the time to explore yet another new corner of Italy and its restaurants.<br> <br>Muir received his Ph.D. from Rutgers University, where he specialized in the Italian Renaissance and did archival research in Venice and Florence, Italy. He is now the Clarence L. Ver Steeg Professor in the Arts and Sciences at Northwestern University and former chair of the history department. At Northwestern he has won several teaching awards. His books include <i>Civic Ritual in Renaissance Venice</i> (1981), <i>Mad Blood Stirring: Vendetta in Renaissance Italy</i> (1993 and 1998), <i>Ritual in Early Modern Europe</i> (1997 and 2005), and <i>The Culture Wars of the Late Renaissance: Skeptics, Libertines, and Opera</i> (2007). His books have also been published in Italian. He is the recipient of the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation Distinguished Achievement Award and is a member of the Academia Europaea and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.<br> <br>Some years ago Muir began to experiment with the use of historical trials in teaching and discovered that students loved them. From that experience he decided to write this textbook, which employs trials as a central feature. He lives beside Lake Michigan in Evanston, Illinois. His twin passions are skiing in the Rocky Mountains and rooting for the Chicago Cubs, who manage every summer to demonstrate that winning isn&#x2019;t everything.<br> <br> <b>Meredith Veldman </b>grew up in the western suburbs of Chicago, where she learned to love winter and the Cubs&#x2013;which might explain her preference for all things impractical and improbable. Certainly that preference is what attracted her to the study of history, filled as it is with impractical people doing the most improbable things. Veldman majored in history at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, Michigan, and then earned a Ph.D. in modern European history, with a concentration in nineteenth- and twentieth-century Britain, from Northwestern University in 1988.<br> <br>As an associate professor of history at Louisiana State University, Veldman teaches courses in nineteenth- and twentieth-century British history and twentieth-century Europe, as well as the second half of &#x201c;Western Civ.&#x201d; In her many semesters in the Western Civ. classroom, Veldman tried a number of different textbooks but found herself increasingly dissatisfied. She wanted a text that would convey to beginning students at least some of the complexities and ambiguities of historical interpretation, introduce them to the exciting work being done in cultural history, and, most important, tell a good story. The search for this textbook led her to accept the offer made by Levack and Muir to join them in writing <i>T</i> <i>he West: Encounters and Transformations</i>.<br> <br>An award-winning teacher, Veldman is also the author of <i>Fantasy, the Bomb, and the Greening of Britain: Romantic Protest, 1945&#x2014;1980</i> (1994) and <i>Margaret Thatcher: Shaping the New Conservatism</i> (2015), and the co-author, with T.

How do these skills differ from those of contemporary actors?<i> Early Modern Actors and Shakespeare's Theatre: Thinking with the Body </i>examines the 'toolkit' of the early modern player and suggests new readings of the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries through the lens of their many skills.</p><p>Theatre is an ephemeral medium. Little remains to us of the plays of Shakespeare and his contemporaries: some printed texts, scattered documents and records, and a few scraps of description, praise, and detraction. Because most of what survives are printed playbooks, students of English theatre find it easy to forget that much of what happened on the early modern stage took place within the gaps of written language: the implicit or explicit calls for fights, dances, military formations, feats of physical skill, song, and clowning. Theatre historians and textual editors have often ignored or denigrated such moments, seeing them merely as extraneous amusements or signs that the text has been 'corrupted' by actors. This book argues that recapturing a positive account of the skills and expertise of the early modern players will result in a more capacious understanding of the nature of theatricality in the period.</p></p><p><b>Evelyn Tribble</b> is Donald Collie Chair and Professor of English at the University of Otago, Dunedin, New Zealand.<p>&#x201c;As a work of theatre history,<i> Early Modern Actors and Shakespeare's Theatre</i> is a compelling introduction to the breadth and depth of players' practices. Its concise and direct prose renders difficult historical and scientific concepts simple to navigate, if not easy to resolve. The text is efficient and fluent, demonstrating its claims using an extensive collection of brief but cogent readings, which it prefers to lengthier, closer interpretations of a given playtext. This invigorating book offers a model for more sustained academic engagement with acting as both historical practice and contemporary craft. As such, it amply serves both researchers and practitioners invested in early modern stage action.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Theatre Survey</i></p><p>&#x201c;Tribble (Univ. of Otago, New Zealand) has written a study that will be of great use to those interested in Shakespeare or English Renaissance drama. As the subtitle infers, the volume engages the idea of the specific skills Renaissance actors needed in order to perform, and how they differ from the skills of contemporary actors. The author devotes chapters to dance, stage combat and fighting, improvisation and wit, and gesture and movement. Drawing on scripts, contemporaneous accounts, and the work of other scholars, Tribble is convincing in framing her contentions and constructing the notion of &#x201c;mindful bodies&#x201d; of actors trained to perform dances and fights for an audience knowledgeable about such practices. In the introduction the author contextualizes the book in the larger body of scholarship on Renaissance performance practice, the theoretical framing of skills, and the examination of kinesic intelligence on reconstructed stages. A conclusion focuses on how re-creation of &#x201c;original performances&#x201d; is often disappointing to contemporary audiences, who are not used to such practices and whose expectations are not trained by film and television. This volume will valuable to the scholar, but even more valuable to contemporary artists who perform Renaissance drama.<br>Summing Up: Highly recommended. Lower-division undergraduates through faculty and professionals.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>CHOICE</i></p><p>&#x201c;<i>Early Modern Actors and Shakespeare's Theatre</i> flips a critical switch and reminds us that we are constantly reading each other's bodies, and that we continually struggle to control our own ... I look forward to deploying Tribble's appealing, lucid prose in my own classroom, and using her work to encourage students to think 'with the body' when?launching their own interpretations. It's worth noting how effortless Tribble makes rather sophisticated intellectual labor appear. Throughout her writings, she demonstrates exhaustive knowledge not only of early modern theater and culture, but also cites studies from cognitive science, sociology, anthropology, and dance-really, anything that might be helpful to our understanding. This interdisciplinary, resourceful, and imaginative pursuit of a largely absent target synthesizes a wealth of thinking. It models what can only be described as profoundly skillful scholarship.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Marginalia Review of Books</i></p><p>&#x201c;Evelyn Tribble is one of the foremost scholars of early modern acting working today ... This detailed study of the physical and cognitive demands of the early modern playhouse sheds new light on the skills possessed by the first performers of plays by Shakespeare and his contemporaries. Situating early modern actors in a &#x201c;distributed cognitive ecology&#x201d; markedly different from that inhabited by actors today, Tribble offers sensitive and well-historicized considerations of, on the one hand, the physical skills required of players and remarked upon by playgoers (gesture, movement, dance, swordplay) and, on the other, &#x201c;the skills behind the skills&#x201d;: qualities such as wit and variety which, while not visible or tangible, were paramount to successful and memorable performance. In doing so, she provides inventive-and often brilliant-re-readings of early modern plays from the ultra-canonical to the most neglected. A masterful bridging of texts and disciplines, the work is important-even essential-reading for any early modern performance scholar ... The book offers a new and exciting framework for the study of even the best-known plays. It can only be hoped that future scholars will continue, so inventively, to bring early modern actors center stage.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Shakespeare Bulletin</i></p><p>&#x201c;An impressive piece of scholarship ... Each chapter is expertly researched and heavily annotated. Tribble plumbs various sources to piece together a contemporary understanding of each performance-related skill, thoroughly contextualizing each point.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Voice and Speech Review</i></p></p><h2>The Gardener&#39;s Guide to Growing Salvias</h2><p>The genus Salvia includes more than 700 species and hundreds of garden-worthy cultivars; given their extreme diversity of color and habit, salvias may truly be the ultimate collector&#39;s plant.

Nelson examine how couples in challenging straits come together and get pregnant so quickly&#x2015;without planning. The authors chronicle the high hopes for forging lasting family bonds that pregnancy inspires, and pinpoint the fatal flaws that often lead to the relationship&#x2019;s demise. They offer keen insight into a radical redefinition of family life where the father-child bond is central and parental ties are peripheral.<br><br>Drawing on years of fieldwork, <i>Doing the Best I Can</i> shows how mammoth economic and cultural changes have transformed the meaning of fatherhood among the urban poor. Intimate interviews with more than 100 fathers make real the significant obstacles faced by low-income men at every step in the familial process: from the difficulties of romantic relationships, to decision-making dilemmas at conception, to the often celebratory moment of birth, and finally to the hardships that accompany the early years of the child's life, and beyond.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;This warm and often moving book cuts through the rampant stereotypes and misconceptions to give us the most insightful treatment yet of fatherhood in the inner city. Nelson and Edin are to be congratulated.&#x201d;&#x2015;Bob Herbert, Distinguished Senior Fellow at Demos and former op-ed columnist for <i>The New York Times.</i><br><br> &#x201c;With a clear-eyed honesty and frankness, Edin and Nelson probe the experiences of fathers among our urban poor, and what they discover is both surprising and hopeful. Edin and Nelson should be applauded for their bold on-the-ground research which pushes us to consider that men whose lives are often marked by disorder having children can often be a stabilizing force. <i>Doing the Best I Can</i> turns many of our assumptions about fatherhood on their head.&#x201d; &#x2015;Alex Kotlowitz, author of <i>There Are No Children Here</i><br><br> "<i>Doing the Best I Can</i> will change the way we think about unwed fatherhood in the inner city. The book, based on in-depth interviews with low-income black and white fathers in Camden NJ and Philadelphia, is a real page-turner. Nelson and Edin&#x2019;s well-written narratives on the lives of low-income fathers, their role as fathers, and relationships with their children are replete with fresh insights. This compelling book is a must-read."&#x2015;William Julius Wilson, Lewis P. and Linda L. Geyser University Professor, Harvard University<br><br> &#x201c;I am confident that this book will instantly become the leading source of information on the nature of unwed fatherhood today. It shows a new path of intimate life for unwed young men, suggesting that marriage is no longer central in low-income young adults&#x2019; intimate partnerships. It will be an eye-opener, a detailed portrait we have not seen before.&#x201d;&#x2015;Andrew Cherlin, Johns Hopkins University<br><br> &#x201c;This book smashes the stereotype of poor dads as the &#x2018;hit and run&#x2019; or &#x2018;deadbeat&#x2019; men who care only about casual sex and have no interest in the resulting kids. It is also unflinchingly honest about the sometimes egregious behavior of the men.

Free from the constraints of running, Hillary takes you inside the intense personal experience of becoming the first woman nominated for president by a major party in an election marked by rage, sexism, exhilarating highs and infuriating lows, stranger-than-fiction twists, Russian interference, and an opponent who broke all the rules. She describes what it was like to run against Donald Trump, the mistakes she made, how she has coped with a shocking and devastating loss, and how she found the strength to pick herself back up afterward. With humor and candor, she tells readers what it took to get back on her feet -- the rituals, relationships, and reading that got her through, and what the experience has taught her about life. She speaks about the challenges of being a strong woman in the public eye, the criticism over her voice, age, and appearance, and the double standard confronting women in politics. She lays out how the 2016 election was marked by an unprecedented assault on our democracy by a foreign adversary. By analyzing the evidence and connecting the dots, Hillary shows just how dangerous theforces are that shaped the outcome, and why Americans need to understand them to protect our values and our democracy in the future. The election of 2016 was unprecedented and historic. What Happened is the story of that campaign and its aftermath -- both a deeply intimate account and a cautionary tale for the nation.</p><p>Hillary Rodham Clinton es la primera mujer en la historia de Estados Unidos que ha sido nominada para presidente por un importante partido pol�tico.

Financial anxieties and the loss of those he loved most had tried him persistently, yet he dismissed the concept of life as a vale of tears and substituted the concept of a "vale of Soul-making."

Yet, despite its complexity, value creation is the objective of every enterprise, every worker, and every leader. The Competing Values Framework can help leaders understand more deeply and act more effectively. In the first book to comprehensively present this framework, the authors discuss its core elements and focus attention on rethinking the notion of value. They emphasize specific tools and techniques leaders can use to institute sustainable change.The Competing Values Framework was developed in response to the need for a broadly applicable model that would foster successful leadership, improve organizational effectiveness, and promote value creation. It helps leaders think differently about value creation and shows them how to clarify purpose, integrate practices, and lead people. Named one of the 40 most important frameworks in the history of business, it has been studied and tested in organizations for more than 25 years. Currently used by hundreds of firms around the world, the Competing Values Framework serves as a map, an organizing mechanism, a sense-making device, a source of new ideas, and a learning system.This accessible resource will be of great use to organizational scholars interested in the concepts of value creation, organizational effectiveness, and competing values; to leaders and managers interested in enhancing and creating value in their organizations; and to change agents and consultants who use the Competing Values Framework as part of their intervention strategies or who are looking to help improve organizations.</p><p>Kim S.

Thakor, John E. Simon Professor of Finance, Olin School of Business, Washington University in St. Louis, US`Both the framework and the book make notable contributions to both theory and practice. The book will be of value to scholars and organization leaders in understanding the concepts of value creation and organizational effectiveness. It will be an aid to consultants in conceptualizing strategies for organizations and in counselling leaders on how to operationalize the concepts in their organizations.&#39; -- S.R. Mohnot, Global Business Review `This is a very readable and excellently presented volume. It will interest anyone concerned with organizational effectiveness and the competing values model.&#39; -- Economic Outlook and Business Review `I recommend this book to anyone wishing to understand and practice leadership. Leadership is often treated in mutually-exclusive categories, such as Theory X vs. Theory Y, managers vs. leaders, transactional vs. transformative, initiation vs. consideration, etc. The Competing Values Framework presented in this book transcends these dualities. It features eight competing but complementary values that are critical for managing today&#39;s complex and pluralistic organizations. The framework emphasizes the need for balance among the eight leadership roles, and an appreciation of the context, timing, and contingencies when the leadership roles facilitate and inhibit collective endeavors. I have followed the development and testing of the Competing Values Framework over the years. It makes important contributions to both theory and practice. It stimulates positive learning outcomes for students and managers.&#39; -- Andrew H.

The key, this book argues, is in providing meaningful customer experiences.<br> <br> Writing in the tradition of Louis Cheskin, one of the founding fathers of market research, the authors of <i>Making Meaning</i> observe, define, and describe the meaningful customer experience. By consciously evoking certain deeply valued meanings through their products, services, and multidimensional customer experiences, they argue, companies can create more value and achieve lasting strategic advantages over their competitors. A few businesses are already discovering this approach, but until now no one has articulated it in such a persuasive and practical way. <i>Making Meaning</i> not only encourages businesses to adopt an innovation process that&#x2019;s centered on meaning, it also tells you how. The book outlines a plan of action and describes the attributes of a meaning-centric innovation team. With insightful real-world examples drawn from the Cheskin company's experience and from the authors' observations of the contemporary global market, this book outlines a plan of action and describes the attributes of a meaning-centric innovation team.<br> <br> Meaningful experiences&#x2014;as distinct from trivial ones&#x2014;reinforce or transform the customer&#x2019;s sense of purpose and significance. The authors&#x2019; vision of a world of meaningful consumption is idealistic, but don&#x2019;t be fooled: this is a straightforward business book with an eye on the ROI. It shows how to bring R&amp;D, design, and marketing together to create&nbsp; deeper and richer experiences for your customers.&nbsp; <i>Making Meaning: How Successful Businesses Deliver Meaningful Customer Experiences</i> is an engaging and practical book for business leaders, explaining how their companies can create more meaningful products and services to better achieve their goals.<br></p><p><b>Steve Diller</b> has more than 20 years of strategy and marketing consulting experience.

At first, the stranded boys cooperate, attempting to gather food, make shelters, and maintain signal fires. Overseeing their efforts are Ralph, "the boy with fair hair," and Piggy, Ralph's chubby, wisdom-dispensing sidekick whose thick spectacles come in handy for lighting fires. Although Ralph tries to impose order and delegate responsibility, there are many in their number who would rather swim, play, or hunt the island's wild pig population. Soon Ralph's rules are being ignored or challenged outright. His fiercest antagonist is Jack, the redheaded leader of the pig hunters, who manages to lure away many of the boys to join his band of painted savages. The situation deteriorates as the trappings of civilization continue to fall away, until Ralph discovers that instead of being hunters, he and Piggy have become the hunted: "He forgot his words, his hunger and thirst, and became fear; hopeless fear on flying feet." Golding's gripping novel explores the boundary between human reason and animal instinct, all on the brutal playing field of adolescent competition. <i>--Jennifer Hubert</i>Few works in literature have received as much popular and critical attention as Nobel Laureate William Golding's Lord of the Flies. Since its publication in 1954, it has amassed a cult following, and has significantly contributed to our dystopian vision of the post-war era. When responding to the novel's dazzling power of intellectual insight, scholars and critics often invoke the works of Shakespeare, Freud, Rousseau, Sartre, Orwell, and Conrad.<p>Golding's aim to "trace the defect of society back to the defect of human nature" is elegantly pursued in this gripping adventure tale about a group of British schoolboys marooned on a tropical island. Alone in a world of uncharted possibilities, devoid of adult supervision or rules, the boys attempt to forge their own society, failing, however, in the face of terror, sin, and evil. Part parable, allegory, myth, parody, political treatise, and apocalyptic vision, Lord of the Flies is perhaps the most memorable tale about "the end of innocence, the darkness of man's heart".</p></p><h2>Introduction to Special Relativity</h2><p>This book gives an excellent introduction to the theory of special relativity. Professor Resnick presents a fundamental and unified development of the subject with unusually clear discussions of the aspects that usually trouble beginners. He includes, for example, a section on the common sense of relativity. His presentation is lively and interspersed with historical, philosophical and special topics (such as the twin paradox) that will arouse and hold the reader&#39;s interest. You&#39;ll find many unique features that help you grasp the material, such as worked-out examples,summary tables,thought questions and a wealth of excellent problems. The emphasis throughout the book is physical. The experimental background, experimental confirmation of predictions, and the physical interpretation of principles are stressed. The book treats relativistic kinematics, relativistic dynamics, and relativity and electromagnetism and contains special appendices on the geometric representation of space-time and on general relativity. Its organization permits an instructor to vary the length and depth of his treatment and to use the book either with or following classical physics. These features make it an ideal companion for introductory courses.</p><p><p><b>Robert Resnick</b> was a physics educator and author of physics textbooks.

It examines the fundamentals of table service, and educates readers on the basics of wine and wine-making. All liquors, including beer, ale and stout, are covered, and the essentials of mixology are shared. It describes the legal issues surrounding alcohol, and presents a case study on the "happy hour" drinker. <b> </b>For those in hospitality careers. </p></p><p>PREFACE <p> The foodservice industry in the United States continues to grow and change, rapidly offering significant employment opportunities for culinarians. According to 1998 figures, the industry employs 9 million people, and according to the National Restaurant Association, this figure will grow to 13 million by the year 2005. </p><p> The culinary profession is a large segment of this number which is projected to reach over 1.9 million participants during the year 2000. It is expected that against this background of explosive growth a significant shortfall of culinarians will exist. </p><p> Therefore, the foodservice industry in the future will present ever challenging, rewarding, and demanding efforts for culinarians. Just consider the size and scope of the foodservice industry in the United States: in 1998 the food service industry reached sales of over $300 billion, and there are over 720,000 locations that might qualify as foodservice establishments. </p><p> With regard to the foodservice market&#x2014;that is, all the people that visit or are expected to visit a foodservice outlet&#x2014;whether it be table service or fast food, two important statistics are worth mentioning:</p><p>Consumers will spend almost 45 percent of every dollar they have available for food on meals and other food away from home. Almost 50 percent of all adults in the United States will visit a foodservice establishment on any typical day. (National Restaurant Association data) </p><p> So what will all this mean for the chef in this new millennium? </p><p> According to U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics data, over one million additional trained chefs will be required to meet planned restaurant expansions. Added to this is the changing role and new demands being placed on culinarians. Foodservice industry leaders have pointed out that a chef's culinary talent will not be sufficient for the new millennium. Today the major portion of a culinarian's skills are defined in mostly technical terms. Conceptual, creative, leadership, team building, managerial skills, and a front of the house focus are just a few examples of the required skills. </p><p> Studies in the United States have shown culinarians not only will have significant responsibility for planning, organizing, directing, and controlling foodservice operations, but also will play critical roles in assuring a "total" customer-satisfaction, quality-dining experience. </p><p> Chefs not only have discovered that they are expected to be outstanding culinarians, but they also need to share in the leadership of the entire guest dining experience. The old foodservice management notion of managing kitchen operations from the back door to the front door has been replaced by management from the "front door to the back door" with the main emphasis on customer satisfaction and retention. </p><p> As foodservice operators seek competitive advantage in a very crowded market, many operators have embraced quality-management strategies. It has been said that quality management is at the business base of the twenty-first century; it will give foodservice operators a competitive edge. </p><p> It is therefore reasonable to assume that chefs of the future will become customer-driven&#x2014;not only skilled in all aspects of high-quality food production but also in the essential elements of what is generally known as "front of the house" skills. The principal driving force behind the modern chef is satisfying guests and retaining them as customers. </p><p> As the foodservice industry continues to grow, Mike Hurst, former president of the National Restaurant Association and owner of the highly successful 15 Street Fisheries in Fort Lauderdale, believes that: </p><p> The foodservice sector of the hospitality industry now at 9 million employees,<br> and growing very fast, clearly there will be a greater need for culinarians with<br> people developmental skills along with great culinary talent and a guest focus.<br> These elements together will produce a formidable combination in any future<br> chef.</p><p></p><p> Life Beyond the Line presents practical and technical aspects of "front of the house" duties which traditionally were only marginally treated as part of a culinarian's training. It is therefore intended that this text not only serve as an informational resource companion for culinarians but also as the basis of a curriculum in front of the house skills to augment culinary skills. </p><p> Additionally this text offers practical guidelines in the areas of dining room service, wine and bar service, elements of guest interactions, and an overview of the legal environment in which service is provided. It also examines the issues of team building, the dynamics of leadership, respect and diversity, and the origins of quality management. A positive team environment&#x2014;so necessary for today's integrated approach success&#x2014;is discussed in detail. </p><p> Life Beyond the Line is different than most texts in the area of education and training for chefs in that it concentrates on noncooking elements. Culinary students are offered a practical framework so as to understand the relevant issues and modern approaches to the complete dining experience for the guest&#x2014;not just as a view from the cooking line. As students progress through Life Beyond the Line, they will find the text "user friendly" in that it uses a rich depth of treatment to the essential and desirable elements of guest relations, dining room service, wines and their service, along with background information on liqueurs, beers, mixology, and training intervention procedures for servers. This text is appropriate for students pursuing an associate-level degree in culinary arts and for practicing culinarians at all levels. </p><p> In today's foodservice arena, those culinarians with a broad knowledge of the aspects of quality, teamwork, leadership, and a guest focus, along with the technical skills in service of wine, alcoholic beverages, and guest relations will be highly sought by foodservice operators.

This exegetical commentary was written to confront the reader with the power and presence of the God of Israel. In a day of profound discouragement and misplaced priorities following the return of the Jews from Babylonian exile, the prophet Haggai sounded a clarion call of rebuke, exhortation, and encouragement to his contemporaries. They had begun to rebuild their own homes and businesses but had been derelict in tending to the construction of the temple and focusing on the Lord. The message of Haggai has an abiding relevance for all who fail to seek first the Kingdom of God and His righteousness. Zechariah not only shared Haggai&#39;s burden about the inertia of the postexilic community, but by vision and dream saw the unfolding of Divine purpose for all of God&#39;s people. Rich in apocalyptic imagery and packed with messianic prediction and allusion, Zechariah&#39;s writings became a favorite of the New Testament evangelists and apostles. No Minor Prophet excels Zechariah in the clarity and triumph by which he looks to the culmination of God&#39;s program of redemption. The burden of this, the last of the Old Testament prophets, was the glaring inconcinnity between the identity of the Jewish community as the people of God and the living out of all that this required of them. Theirs was not the problem of rebuilding the Temple and holy city, for that had long been done by Malachi&#39;s day; rather, it was the issue of holy living and holy service in the aftermath of all the external accomplishments. Malachi still speaks to the modern world about the need to bring performance into line with profession. His message is current, especially in light of the coming of the One of whom the prophet so eloquently spoke.</p><p></p><h2>Frege: Philosophy of Mathematics</h2><p><p>No one has figured more prominently in the study of the German philosopher Gottlob Frege than Michael Dummett. His magisterial <i>Frege: Philosophy of Language</i> is a sustained, systematic analysis of Frege's thought, omitting only the issues in philosophy of mathematics. In this work Dummett discusses, section by section, Frege's masterpiece<i> The Foundations of Arithmetic</i> and Frege's treatment of real numbers in the second volume of <i>Basic Laws of Arithmetic</i>, establishing what parts of the philosopher's views can be salvaged and employed in new theorizing, and what must be abandoned, either as incorrectly argued or as untenable in the light of technical developments.</p><p>Gottlob Frege (1848-1925) was a logician, mathematician, and philosopher whose work had enormous impact on Bertrand Russell and later on the young Ludwig Wittgenstein, making Frege one of the central influences on twentieth-century Anglo-American philosophy; he is considered the founder of analytic philosophy. His philosophy of mathematics contains deep insights and remains a useful and necessary point of departure for anyone seriously studying or working in the field.</p></p><p>Michael Dummett was Wykeham Professor of Logic Emeritus in the University of Oxford.</p><h2>Divine Discourse: Philosophical Reflections on the Claim that God Speaks</h2><p>The canonical texts and traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam claim that God speaks, but philosophers usually mistakenly treat such speech as revelation. Wolterstorff argues that contemporary speech-action theory offers a fascinating approach to the claim. He develops an innovative theory of interpretation along the way opposing the current near-consensus of Ricoeur and Derrida that there is something wrong-headed about interpreting a text to find out what its author said.</p><p>The canonical texts and traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam claim that God speaks, but philosophers usually mistakenly treat such speech as revelation. This study develops an innovative means of interpreting the claim based on contemporary speech-action theory.Divine discourse comprises Nicholas Wolterstorff&#39;s philosophical reflections on the claim that God speaks. This claim figures large in the canonical texts and traditions of Judaism, Christianity, and Islam, but there has been remarkably little philosophical reflection on it, in good measure (so Professor Wolterstorff argues) because philosophers have mistakenly assimilated divine speech to divine revelation. He embraces contemporary speech-action theory as his basic approach to language; and after expanding the theory beyond its usual applications, concludes that the claim that God performs illocutionary actions is coherent and entails no obvious falsehoods. Moving on to issues of interpretation, he considers how one would interpret a text if one wanted to find out what God was saying thereby. Prominent features of this part of the discussion are his defense, against Ricoeur and Derrida, of the legitimacy of interpreting a text to find out what its author said, and his analysis of the double hermeneutic involved when the discourse of one person is appropriated into the discourse of another person. The book closes with a discussion of the epistemological question of whether we are entitled to believe that God speaks.</p><h2>The Politics of Sin: Drugs, Alcohol and Public Policy (American Political Institutions &amp; Public Policy)</h2><p>This work demonstrates the value of a multi-method approach to public policy analysis, arguing that descriptive historical studies, quantitative historical studies and cross-sectional quantitative studies are essentially compatible.</p><p></p><h2>The Portrait of a Lady</h2><p>Newly arrived in Europe, Isabel is an independent woman searching for her destiny.

Their supposed author, a mythical figure named Hermes Trismegistus, was thought to be a contemporary of Moses. The Hermetic philosophy was regarded as an ancient theology, parallel to the revealed wisdom of the Bible, supporting Biblical revelation and culminating in the Platonic philosophical tradition. This new translation is the only English version based on reliable texts, and Professor Copenhaver&#39;s introduction and notes make this accessible and up-to-date edition an indispensable resource to scholars.</p><p>Regarded as an ancient theology, parallel to the revealed wisdom of the Bible, Hermetic philosophy supported Biblical revelation and culminated in the Platonic philosophical tradition.

Inventive and ambitious minds were hard at work. Soon that spark was fanned, and a fiery war was under way to be the first to light&#x2015;and run&#x2015;the world with electricity. Thomas Alva Edison, the inventor of direct current (DC), engaged in a brutal battle with Nikola Tesla and George Westinghouse, the inventors of alternating current (AC). There would be no ties in this race&#x2015;only a winner and a loser. The prize: a nationwide monopoly in electric current. Brimming with action, suspense, and rich historical and biographical information about these brilliant inventors, here is the rousing account of one of the world&#x2019;s defining scientific competitions. </p><p><b>Christy Ottaviano Books</b></p></p><p><b>School Library Journal</b><i>Gr 7 Up</i>-A narrative nonfiction account of the cutthroat competition among Thomas Alva Edison, Nikola Tesla, George Westinghouse, and a host of stakeholders during the Gilded Age in the United States. This volume is plainly about the intersecting ventures of three white men and is void of discussion about race and gender dynamics in this history. That said, a sense of morbid fascination will grab readers as the author opens the book with a retelling of the first execution by electric chair. This chilling moment serves as an entrance to the crux of the narrative--the battle between alternating and direct current electricity. The informal tone makes the prose quite inviting and the text is rich with anecdotes, such as Tesla's inventive inspiration via the family cat and Westinghouse's revelation via a magazine subscription solicitation, which illustrates the debut author's careful research and commitment to storytelling. Edison is characterized as viciously competitive, defending his direct current system. Meanwhile, Westinghouse is shown as a benevolent leader, and Tesla embodies enigma until his final days. Scientific explanations are incorporated, but this work focuses on the social aspects of this "war."&nbsp;<b>VERDICT:</b>&nbsp;Purchase where narrative nonfiction flies off the shelves.<i>- Angela Wiley, Carnegie Library of Pittsburgh</i><br><br><b>Praise for The Electric War</b><br>&nbsp;<br>A Junior Library Guild Selection<br>An Amazon Best Book of the Month<br>A Grateful American Book Prize Honor Book</p><h2>The Old Capital</h2><p>Chieko, the adopted daughter of devoted parents, accidentaly meets her unknown twin sister at a festival</p><p>Text: English (translation)Whether this subtle and brooding novel, here making its first appearance in English, deserves to rank alongside Snow Country and Thousand Cranes as one of Kawabata's major works is debatable, but it contains all the Nobel laureate's most striking characteristicsacute esthetic sensibility, preoccupation with the clash between old and new, pervasive melancholy and a story line suggestive of a Zen brush-and-ink painting where what is omitted is as important as what is included.

It is regarded as one of the most significant works of religious English literature, has been translated into more than 200 languages, and has never been out of print. Bunyan began his work while in the Bedfordshire county prison for violations of the Conventicle Act, which prohibited the holding of religious services outside the auspices of the established Church of England. Early Bunyan scholars like John Brown believed The Pilgrim's Progress was begun in Bunyan's second, shorter imprisonment for six months in 1675,but more recent scholars like Roger Sharrock believe that it was begun during Bunyan's initial, more lengthy imprisonment from 1660&#x2013;72 right after he had written his spiritual autobiography, Grace Abounding to the Chief of Sinners.</p><p>John Bunyan&#39;s classic allegory of Christian&#39;s journey to the Celestial City, abridged and updated for the modern reader.Kessinger Publishing reprints over 1,500 similar titles all available through Amazon.com.</p><h2>Field &amp; Laboratory Exercises in Environmental Science, 7th edition</h2><p>The major objectives of a lab class, and this manual, are to provide students with hands on experiences that are relevent, easy to understand and applicable to the student&#39;s life, presented in an interesting, informative format.

In his gem-like first novel, Forrest Gander writes of friendship, envy, and eros as a harmonic of charged overtones. Set in a rural southern landscape as vivid as its indelible characters, <em>As a Friend</em> tells the story of Les, a gifted man and land surveyor, whose impact on those around him (his friend Clay, his girlfriend Sarah) provokes intense self-examination and an atmosphere of dangerous eroticism. With poetic insight, Gander explores the nature of attraction, betrayal, and loyalty. What he achieves is brilliant in style and powerfully unsettling.</p><p>Forrest Gander was born in the Mojave Desert and grew up in Virginia. In addition to writing poetry, he has translated works by Coral Bracho, Alfonso D&#x2019;Aquino, Pura Lopez-Colome, Pablo Neruda, and Jaime Saenz. The recipient of grants from the Library of Congress, the Guggenheim, Howard, Whiting, and United States Artists Foundations, he taught for many years as the AK Seaver Professor of Literary Arts &amp; Comparative Literature at Brown University.An adoring friendship turns deadly in poet and translator Gander's visceral if too brief first novel. Les is the magnetic, godlike protagonist of this reflective four-part narrative: introduced at the time of his difficult birth to a teenage mother, he is put up for adoption. Years later, he is observed by Clay, a colleague on his land-surveying team in a small town in Arkansas, who finds his friend's mannerisms and dissembling so compelling that he apes Les and eventually betrays him. Les, a part-time poet and practical joker, is beloved for his eccentricities, especially by his second wife, Cora, and mistress, Sarah, whose poetic remembrances of Les after his suicide make up the novel's third section and reveal hopelessly guilt-ridden Sarah to be angry, grieving for her tender, quirky lover. Gander's passionate construction of Les reveals a character deeply conflicted, comprising enormous virtue and many flaws, though in the end the work remains piecemeal and incomplete, though nicely done. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Exploring such themes and events as funerals, dance and music, letters and literature, spectacles and monuments, and world&#39;s fairs and food, a group of leading historians examines the ways that a wide range of individuals with a variety of motives attempted to forge identity, turn the world upside down, mock their betters, forget their troubles through dance, express love in letters, and altogether enjoy life. Drawing on a rich array of case studies, this text introduces the complexity of motives behind and the diversity of expression of popular culture in Latin America.</p><p><b>William H. Beezley</b> is professor of history at the University of Arizona. <b>Linda A. Curcio-Nagy</b> is associate professor of history at the University of Nevada, Reno.William Beezley and Linda Curcio-Nagy demonstrate the centrality of popular culture to the understanding of history. They analyze song, dance, ceremony, funerals, regalia, icons, exhibitions, protest, and literature to measure values and provide deep insights regarding class, gender, and race. This book is a tour de force. (John Mason Hart, University of Houston)<br><br>This revision of a foundational text on the history of Latin American popular culture brings exciting energy to an already dynamic field. New essays and the revised introduction further expand our understanding of a wide range of everyday cultural practices&#x2014;music, dance, love letters, funerals, cooking, popular celebrations&#x2014;and their complex relationship with elite national building projects. In conjunction with the best essays from the previous edition, this new material gives us a fascinating, provocative, and insightful glimpse into a vital aspect of Latin American history&#x2014;one that still eludes most historical studies of the region. Reading this edition, I was struck even more forcibly by the ingenuity of historians of popular culture and by the impossibility of making sense of Latin American history without it. (Robert Buffington, University of Colorado)<br><br>Latin American Popular Culture since Independence demonstrates that history can be serious fun. This wide-ranging collection leads the reader along less traveled paths through Latin America&#x2019;s last two centuries. Moreover, it brings together a distinguished group of talented researchers who share their expertise with wit and sensitivity. The individual essays truly bring unvarnished practices and unheralded historical actors to life, whether they treat religion, dance, death, food, or forms of story telling. Aside from describing past practices, these scholars also examine historical efforts to alter and shape popular culture and fashion national identity. It is a truly riveting examination of culture as lived, invented, and often manipulated in modern Latin American history.

Tragically, there were no survivors. The 353 aboard represented a significant cross-section of the population of the Yukon and Alaska, and their loss was a heavy blow to a society that, with the end of the gold rush, was already in decline. This book tells the dramatic stories of many of the passengers, how they had gone to the north, what they did there, and why they were leaving that fall, and sheds light on a little-known aspect of Alaska's history. </p></p><p>BILL MORRISON was a professor and administrator at universities in Ontario, Manitoba, and British Columbia and a visiting professor in the United States before he retired in 2010.

Reid, redefines the way statistics can be taught and learned. Unlike other books that merely focus on procedures, Reid&#x2019;s approach balances development of critical thinking skills with application of those skills to contemporary statistical analysis. He goes beyond simply presenting techniques by focusing on the key concepts readers need to master in order to ensure their long-term success. Indeed, this exciting new book offers the perfect foundation upon which readers can build as their studies and careers progress to more advanced forms of statistics. </p> <p>Keeping computational challenges to a minimum, Reid shows readers not only how to conduct a variety of commonly used statistical procedures, but also when each procedure should be utilized and how they are related. Following a review of descriptive statistics, he begins his discussion of inferential statistics with a two-chapter examination of the Chi Square test to introduce students to hypothesis testing, the importance of determining effect size, and the need for post hoc tests. When more complex procedures related to interval/ratio data are covered, students already have a solid understanding of the foundational concepts involved. Exploring challenging topics in an engaging and easy-to-follow manner, Reid builds concepts logically and supports learning through robust pedagogical tools, the use of SPSS, numerous examples, historical quotations, insightful questions, and helpful progress checks.</p></p><p><strong>Howard M.

On March 18, 1998, the CIA&#x2019;s Inspector General, Fred Hitz, told astounded US Reps that the CIA had maintained relationships with companies and individuals that the Agency knew to be involved in the drug business. More shocking was the revelation that the CIA had received from Reagan&#x2019;s Justice Department clearance not to report any knowledge it might have of drug-dealing by CIA assets. Many years&#x2019; worth of CIA denials, much of it under oath to Congress, were sunk. Hitz&#x2019;s admissions made fools of some of the most prominent names in US journalism and vindicated others that had been ruined. Particularly resonant was the case of the San Jose Mercury News, which published a sensational series on CIA involvement in the smuggling of cocaine into black urban neighborhoods, and then under pressure conspired in the destruction of its own reporter, Gary Webb. In Whiteout, Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair finally put the whole story together, from the earliest days, when the CIA&#x2019;s institutional ancestors cut a deal with America&#x2019;s premier gangster and drug trafficker, Lucky Luciano. This is a thrilling history that stretches from Sicily in 1944 to the killing fields of Laos and Vietnam, to CIA safe houses in Greenwich Village and San Francisco where CIA men watched Agency-paid prostitutes feed LSD to unsuspecting clients. We meet Oliver North, as he plotted with Manuel Noriega and Central American gangsters. We travel to little-known airports in Costa Rica and Arkansas. We hear from drug pilots and accountants from the Cali Cartel. We learn of DEA agents whose careers were ruined because they tried to tell the truth. Cockburn and St. Clair show how the CIA&#x2019;s complicity with drug-dealing criminal gangs was part and parcel of its attacks on labor organizers, whether on the docks of New York, Marseilles, or Shanghai. They trace how the Cold War and counter-insurgency led to an alliance between the Agency and the vilest of war criminals like Klaus Barbie, or fanatic opium traders like the mujahedin in Afghanistan. Cockburn and St. Clair horrifyingly affirm charges of outraged black communities that the CIA had undertaken enduring programs of experiments on minorities. They show that the CIA imported Nazi scientists straight from their labs at Dachau and Buchenwald and set to work, developing chemical and biological agents, tested on blacks, some of them in mental hospitals. Cockburn and St. Clair dissect the shameful way American journalists have not only turned a blind eye to the Agency&#x2019;s misdeeds, but also helped plunge the knife into those who tried to tell the truth. Fact-packed and fast-paced, Whiteout is a richly detailed excavation of the CIA&#x2019;s dirtiest secrets. For anyone who wants to know the real truth about the Agency, this is the book to start with.</p><p>Alexander Cockburn and Jeffrey St. Clair take the revelations of the links between the Central Intelligence Agency, the Nicaraguan Contras, and the Los Angeles crack market that journalist Gary Webb exposed in 1996--revelations that are the basis of Webb's book <i>Dark Alliance</i>--and use them as a springboard for a tale of the U.S. government's involvement with the illegal drug trade that extends much further back than Webb's tale.<p> The specific revelations are not, perhaps, entirely new; many know, for example, that even before there was a CIA, the WWII-era Office of Strategic Services enlisted the aid of gangster "Lucky" Luciano in arranging support among the Sicilian Mafia for the American invasion of Italy, or that the CIA was actively involved in the Southeast Asian opium trade during the Vietnam War. But Cockburn and St. Clair persuasively argue that the traditional explanation for such events--"rogue elements"--is deliberately misleading, and that the mainstream "liberal" press plays an active role in this obfuscation (noting, for example, that Webb's three biggest attackers were the <i>New York Times</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>, and <i>Washington Post</i>). By providing an overarching narrative rather than treating these incidents as isolated, the authors present a damning indictment of the CIA--but one that fully admits that the agency was not acting on its own, but was merely fulfilling the mandates of the American government. <i>--Ron Hogan</i></p><b>Alexander Cockburn</b> co-edits <i>CounterPunch</i> with Jeffrey St. Clair.

In <em>Growing in Love and Wisdom</em>, she draws on this unique dual perspective to explore the value of interreligious dialogue, the spiritual dynamics that operate across faith traditions, and how Buddhist meditation practices can deepen Christian prayer. She begins by examining the values and principles shared by the two faiths and shows that both traditions seek to effect a fundamental transformation in the lives of believers. Both stress the need for experiences with deep emotional resonance that goes beyond the level of concepts to touch the heart. The center of the book offers 15 Tibetan Buddhist contemplative practices, adapted for Christian use. Stabile provides clear instructions on how to do these meditations and helpful commentary on each, explaining its purpose and the relation between the Buddhist original and her Christian adaptation of it. Throughout, she highlights the many remarkably close parallels between the teachings of Jesus and the Buddha. The meditations offered in this unusual book will be extremely useful to thoughtful Christians, to those responsible for giving spiritual direction, and also to Buddhist sympathizers who will be intrigued and pleased to see familiar contemplations handled so skillfully by a former Buddhist practitioner who has gratefully learned so much from her former religion and now introduces the riches of that tradition to her fellow Christians.<br></p><p><br><strong>Susan J. Stabile</strong> is the Robert and Marion Short Distinguished Chair in Law at the University of St. Thomas School of Law, where she also serves as a fellow of both the Holloran Center for Ethical Leadership and the Terrence J. Murphy Institute for Catholic Thought, Law and Public Policy. Trained as a spiritual director and in retreat ministry, she offers individual spiritual direction and conducts retreats and other spiritual formation programs at the law school, in parishes and in other venues. She is the author of the blog Creo en Dios.<br><br>"A gentle gift to the work of interreligious existence in the 21st century... Stabile faithfully and reasonably steers a course between with this lucid, welcome offering. <em>Growing in Love and Wisdom</em> embodies for us the insights of <em>Nostra Aetate</em> in action -- rejecting nothing that is true and holy, and regarding with sincere reverence those practices of Buddhist meditation that reflect the Truth which enlightens all humanity... This rich resource can be of profitable use in an undergraduate classroom considering interreligious matters, or in a broad introduction to spirituality. Highly recommended for personal, parish or academic use." --<em>Catholic Books Review</em><p></p><br>"In the growing crowd of books on Buddhist-Christian dialogue, this one is different. It's a 'hands-on' book. Susan Stabile's intent is to help Christians learn from what Buddhists <em>do</em>, rather than from what they <em>believe</em>. In practical, step-by-step instructions on how Christians can use Tibetan techniques of meditation, she opens new possibilities of clarifying and deepening Christian experience. This is a book for those who what to practice before they preach, or are preached to."--Paul F. Knitter, Paul Tillich Professor of Theology, World Religions, and Culture, Union Theological Seminary, New York<p></p><br>"Stabile's very readable book lucidly presents similarities in values between Christianity and Tibetan Buddhism. Her clearly-explained prayer suggestions for Christians, which make up most of the book, are adapted from Buddhist practice and are mainly discursive in nature. They offer a rich variety of ways in which their Christian spiritual life can be enriched by Eastern teachings."--Mary Jo Meadow, author of <em>Christian Insight Meditation: Following in the Footsteps of John of the Cross</em><p></p><br>"A new standard for the possibilities in authentic, deeply rooted inter-religious dialogue... the book is beautifully written, in a simple yet clear style, making its deft navigation of interaith ideas ring with clarity." --Carl McColman, <em>carlmccolman.com</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Precalculus, Instructor&#39;s Annotated Edition, 5th Edition</h2><p>As the best-seller in its field, Precalculus, 5/e, offers both instructors and students a more solid, comprehensive, and flexible program than ever before.

R. Gurney, Vol. II: Collected Plays, 1974-1983 (Contemporary American Playwrights) (A. R. Gurney Collected Plays)</h2><p>The six plays in this collection all link personal and cultural change. Two are set in summer places, where families go for awhile every year as a release from where they live the rest of the time. One is set in an early twentieth century city in transition, while another takes place in a motel--by definition a place of passage. Two are set in particular rooms: a dining room, and the trophy room of a private club. The nostalgic appeal of these plays arises from their delightfully comprehensive anthropological accuracy. Not only are they an encyclopedia of droll, even arcane cultural ritual, but they are written in the perfectly pitched, dry, and very funny voice of the participants themselves. Yet even as Pete Gurney is fondly evoking this world, he shows it to be under siege, not from without, but from within. - David Trainer, Introduction</p><p>A.R. Gurney was born in Buffalo, New York in 1930 and attended St. Paul&#39;s School in Concord, New Hampshire. He graduated Magna Cum Laude and Phi Beta Kappa from Williams College, and, after serving as an Officer in the United States Navy, he graduated from the Yale School of Drama in 1958. He was a Professor of Literature at M.I.T. for over twenty years. Mr. Gurney also has received honorary degrees from both Williams College and the State University of New York at Buffalo. He has written several novels: The Gospel According to Joe, Entertaining Strangers, and The Snow Ball, later adapted to a play of the same name. For the opera he wrote libretto for &#34;Strawberry Fields&#34; with music by Micael Torke, part of the Central Park Opera Trilogy presented by the New York City Opera in the Fall of 1999. Mr. Gurney has been the recipient of numerous awards, including: a Drama Desk Award; a National Endowment for the Arts Playwriting Award; the Rockefeller Playwriting Award; the Lucille Lortel Playwriting Award; a New England Theatre Conference Award; and an Award of Merit from the American Academy and Institute of Arts and Letters. Mr. Gurney currently resides in Roxbury, Connecticut with his wife, Mary; they have four children and six grandchildren.Gurney has carved out a niche for himself in the landscape of Americana, though with these plays he did not have the success he deserved in the commercial theater. This collection of six early works includes his best known, The Dining Room (1982), as well as Children, Richard Corey, The Middle Ages, The Wayside Inn, and What I Did Last Summer. A wry observer of our collectively dysfunctional culture, Gurney invokes a nostalgia for the past, which seems more stable, restrictive, and orderly than the present. At the same time, his plays resonate with longing for a freedom that only the future can bring. They lament the loss of the Father as a strong unifying figure?what could be more American??and chart the painful compromises we make to achieve some stability and some freedom. They also seek a fluidity of form, time, and place to express these ideas, which are successfully balanced in three of the plays here. The others allow us to see the artist struggling to achieve that balance. Recommended for contemporary drama collections in public and academic libraries.?Thomas E.

Yet these German auxiliaries, or mercenaries were only one instance of a frequent military practice, approved by international jurists of the time and used by the British in all their eighteenth-century wars. This study (dealing with one of the six contingents known inaccurately as the Hessians) is the first to make extensive use of manuscript sources in Germany, Britain and America to put the Hessians in their historical context and to examine a number of the myths about them. The encounter of the Americans with the Hessian troops from a disciplined paternalistic society organized for war, with special thoroughness, was not merely the meeting of two military systems, but also of two ways of life, and is thus worthy of study in an age of conflict.</p><p>This study uses German, British and American manuscript sources to put the Hessians in their historical context.

Well-known archaeologist Barbara Little addresses these key questions for introductory students in this concise, inexpensive, and well-written text. Little covers the goals of historical archaeological work, the kinds of questions it asks, and the ethical and political concerns it raises. She shows what historical archaeology can provide that neither of its parent disciplines can offer alone. Little offers brief snapshots of key American sites: Jamestown, Mission San Luis, West Oakland, the African American Burial Ground, and the Garbage Project, among others. And she shows how historical archaeology is inextricably linked to public education, justice issues, and our collective understanding of the past. As an introductory guide for historical archaeology and similar courses, or as thought-provoking reading for professionals, this volume is unmatched in quality and scope.</p><p>Barbara Little is a historical archaeologist with a long history of federal archaeological service and teaching. She is editor of Public Benefits of Archaeology (Florida, 2002) and coauthor (with Donald Hardesty) of Assessing Site Significance (AltaMira 2000), among other publications."Little&#x2019;s book contains a wealth of ideas and thoughtful exploration, relevant well beyond its United States focus. As an archaeologist working within a government context, the book was useful to me in considering how archaeology and heritage management fir within the idea that social change is a desired objective of government action." &#x2014;Steve Brown, Australasian Historica Archaeology<br><br>"The undoubted strength of Historical Archaeology is Little&#x2019;s clear, concise and chatty writing style, with its frequent use of the first person pronoun. Many first- and second-year undergraduates will find Little&#x2019;s engaging approach infinitely preferable to the starchier style of more traditional text books." - Australian Archaeology<br><br>"Barbara Little is a top US historical archaeologist and this book is a fast-paced, highly readable, and eminently sensible introduction to the subject. What really comes across is her passionate commitment to the idea that archaeology has a central role to play in understanding the recent past." - Current Archaeology<br><br>"Historical Archaeology: Why the Past Matters is a thoroughly engaging text exploring the nature of archaeology of periods thought to be well known through documentary evidence and discussing how we handle the archaeology of that past. Succinctly and concisely written." &#x2014;Archaeology Ireland<br><br>"Barbara Little's book is easy to read and raises the readers's consciousness about the value of historic archaeology. It is a must read for both aspiring and experienced historical archaeologists as well as archaeologists passionate about their prehistoric archaeology." &#x2014;Newsletter of the Archaeological Society of Maryland // "Well-known archaeologist Barbara Little has written a primer for this emerging field. In it she covers the key questions posed by historical archaeology and the ethical and politcial concerns they raise. Little imparts case studies of important projects like Jamestown, Virgina; Mission San Luis, Florida; and the Garbage Project to illustrate her points. Historical Archaeology is a fine introduction to the field of study that relates to public education, issues of justice, and our understanding of the past." &#x2014;American Archaeology // "You couldn&#x2019;t ask for a more engaging and interesting guide. Using clear and fascinating examples, Barbara Little explains how historical archaeologists carry out their work. She convincingly demonstrates that knowledge of the American past sheds light on our current circumstances and helps us move forward to better future. A real tour de force!" &#x2014;Elizabeth Brumfiel, Northwestern University // "A fine starting point for an historical archaeology class...this book would also serve enlightened introductory archaeology or four-field anthropology instructors who wish to include historical archaeology in their courses. Engagingly written without being patronizing, I would certainly use this in my classes." &#x2014;Elizabeth Scott, Illinois State University // "Little has produced a high-quality, intellectually-stimulating, and thought-provoking book. The text is thoroughly engaging. Her use of anecdotes and humor is delightful, drawing the reader into the dialogue in a most compelling way. The emphasis on socially responsible scholarship is a particularly appealing feature of the text. Our discipline was fundamentally altered during the late 1980s and early 1990s with the passing of NAGPRA legislation, the New York African Burial Ground project, and similar issues. I have struggled to find appropriate texts that bring these issues to the foreground. Little does this brilliantly. This text will serve well as the backbone upon which a course is built. I believe this text would have broad appeal within historical archaeology." &#x2014;Deborah L. Rotman, University of Notre Dame // "Historical Archaeology has something for everyone interested in the US past. For undergraduates and professionals unfamiliar with archaeology Little has written and engaging overview of the questions, practices, and solutions of contemporary historical archaeology. For her professional colleagues, Little&#x2019;s distinctive perspective, gained from years in federal and academic archaeology, has lead her to refreshingly novel syntheses of the American past and understandings about the emerging field of Public Archaeology. Herein are ideas aplenty that will influence the thinking and practice of our discipline into the 21st century." &#x2014;Robert Paynter, University of Massachusetts // " Historical archaeology students, educators, and general readers will find a rewarding experience in the pages of Barbara Little's book. They will encounter wide-ranging case studies contextualized in many key issues in contemporary historical archaeology, they will discover the basic tenets of historical archaeological practice and theory presented through accessible prose, and they will be exposed to many reasons&#x2014;political, social, economic, and cultural&#x2014;why the past really does matter. Those who doubt the vitality or relevance of historical archaeology need only read this little book with a big perspective to be convinced otherwise. ..The book is designed as a text for introductory courses in historical archaeology but it should find an audience in general archaeology courses that include (as they should!) examples of historical archaeology." &#x2014;Stephen Silliman, Journal of Anthropological Research</p><h2>Domestic Relations, Cases and Materials (University Casebook Series)</h2><p>The Eighth Edition progresses from the format of earlier editions by continuing to provide cases from state, federal and international courts that integrate the scope and dynamism of family law. There are references to uniform, state, federal and international code provisions and there is available a companion book offering additional statutes and uniform laws that may be integrated into the family law course. It incorporates problems to test students&#x2019; understanding of the material, and it is compatible with courses of two, three, or four credits.

The major features include: </p> <ul> <li>A new comprehensive chapter on matrix algebra</li> <li>A new chapter on beams and frames</li> <li>New sections on axisymmetric elements and formulations</li> <li>A new section on <i>p</i>-method and <i>h</i>-method</li> <li>A new section on unsteady heat transfer</li> <li>A new chapter on dynamic problems</li> <li>A new chapter on design and material selection</li> <li>Two new appendices with properties of area shapes and properties of structural steel shapes</li> <li>A new appendix with examples of batch files</li> <li>A web site to offer additional information for instructors and students</li> </ul> <p> Moreover, a large number of problems have been added, and the property tables have been expanded. I hope you enjoy the second edition. </p> <p> There are many good textbooks already in existence that cover the theory of finite element methods for advanced students. However, none of these books incorporate ANSYS as an integral part of their materials to introduce finite element modeling to undergraduate students and newcomers. In recent years, the use of finite element analysis as a design tool has grown rapidly. Easy-to-use, comprehensive packages such as ANSYS, a general-purpose finite element computer program, have become common tools in the hands of design engineers. Unfortunately, many engineers who lack the proper training or understanding of the underlying concepts have been using these tools. This introductory book is written to assist engineering students and practicing engineers new to the field of finite element modeling to gain a clear understanding of the basic concepts. The text offers insight into the theoretical aspects of finite element analysis and also covers some practical aspects of modeling. Great care has been exercised to avoid overwhelming students with theory, yet enough theoretical background is offered to allow individuals to use ANSYS intelligently and effectively. ANSYS is an integral part of this text. In each chapter, the relevant basic theory is discussed first and demonstrated using simple problems with hand calculations. These problems are followed by examples that are solved using ANSYS. Exercises in the text are also presented in this manner. Some exercises require manual calculations, while others, more complex in nature, require the use of ANSYS. The simpler hand-calculation problems will enhance students' understanding of the concepts by encouraging them to go through the necessary steps in a finite element analysis. Design problems are also included at the end of Chapters 3, 4, 6, and 9 through 14. </p> <p> Various sources of error that can contribute to incorrect results are discussed. A good engineer must always find ways to check the results. While experimental testing of models may be the best way, such testing may be expensive or time consuming. Therefore, whenever possible, throughout this text emphasis is placed on doing a "sanity check" to verify one's finite element analysis (FEA). A section at the end of each appropriate chapter is devoted to possible approaches for verifying ANSYS results. </p> <p> Another unique feature of this book is that the last two chapters are devoted to the introduction of design, material selection, optimization, and parametric programming with ANSYS. </p> <p> The book is organized into 15 chapters. Chapter 1 reviews basic ideas in finite element analysis. Common formulations, such as direct, potential energy, and weighted residual methods are discussed. Chapter 2 provides a comprehensive review of matrix algebra. Chapter 3 deals with the analysis of trusses, because trusses offer economical solutions to many engineering structural problems. An overview of the ANSYS program is given in Chapter 3 so that students can begin to use ANSYS right away. Finite element formulation of members under axial loading, beams, and frames are introduced in Chapter 4. Chapter 5 lays the foundation for analysis of one-dimensional problems by introducing one-dimensional linear, quadratic, and cubic elements. Global, local, and natural coordinate systems are also discussed in detail in Chapter 5. An introduction to isoparametric formulation and numerical integration by Gauss-Legendre formulae are also presented in Chapter 5. Chapter 6 considers Galerkin formulation of one-dimensional heat transfer and fluid problems. Two-dimensional linear and higher order elements are introduced in Chapter 7. Gauss-Legendre formulae for two-dimensional integrals are also presented in Chapter 7. In Chapter 8 the essential capabilities and the organization of the ANSYS program are covered. The basic steps in creating and analyzing a model with ANSYS is discussed in detail. Chapter 9 includes the analysis of two-dimensional heat transfer problems with a section devoted to unsteady situations. Chapter 10 provides analysis of torsion of noncircular shafts and plane stress problems. Dynamic problems are explored in Chapter 11. Review of dynamics and vibrations of mechanical and structural systems are also given in this chapter. In Chapter 12, two-dimensional, ideal fluid-mechanics problems are analyzed. Direct formulation of the piping network problems and underground seepage flow are also discussed. Chapter 13 provides a discussion of three-dimensional elements and formulations. This chapter also presents basic ideas regarding top-down and bottom-up solid modeling methods. The last two chapters of the book are devoted to design and optimization ideas. Design process and material selection are explained in Chapter 14. Design optimization ideas and parametric programming are discussed in Chapter 15. Each chapter begins by stating the objectives and concludes by summarizing what the reader should have gained from studying that chapter. </p> <p> The examples that are solved using ANSYS show in great detail how to use ANSYS to model and analyze a variety of engineering problems. Chapter 8 is also written such that it can be taught right away if the instructor sees the need to start with ANSYS. </p> <p> A brief review of appropriate fundamental principles in solid mechanics, heat transfer, dynamics, and fluid mechanics is also provided throughout the book. Additionally, when appropriate; students are warned about becoming too quick to generate finite element models for problems for which there exist simple analytical solutions. Mechanical and thermophysical properties of some common materials used in engineering are given in appendices A and B. Appendices C and D give properties of common area shapes and properties of structural steel shapes, respectively. Examples of ANSYS batch files are given in Appendix F. </p> <p> Finally, a Web site at <b>http://www.prenhall.com/Moaveni</b> will be maintained for the following purposes: (1) to share any changes in the upcoming versions of ANSYS; (2) to share additional information on upcoming text revisions; (3) to provide additional homework problems and design problems; and (4) although I have done my best to eliminate errors and mistakes, as is with most books, same errors may still exist. I will post the corrections that are brought to my attention at the site. The Web site will be accessible to all instructors and students. </p> <p> SAEED MOAVENI </p></p><h2>Ducks of the World in Full-Color Paintings (Pictorial Archive)</h2><p>The artists represented in this beautiful book- Frank W.

But who doesn't enjoy it when an arrogant but untalented contestant is humiliated on <em>American Idol,</em> or when the embarrassing vice of a self-righteous politician is exposed, or even when an envied friend suffers a small setback? The truth is that joy in someone else's pain-known by the German word <em>schadenfreude</em>--permeates our society.<br><br>In <em>The Joy of Pain,</em> psychologist Richard Smith, one of the world's foremost authorities on envy and shame, sheds much light on a feeling we dare not admit. Smith argues that <em>schadenfreude</em> is a natural human emotion, one worth taking a closer look at, as it reveals much about who we are as human beings. We have a passion for justice. Sometimes, <em>schadenfreude</em> can feel like getting one's revenge, when the suffering person has previously harmed us. But most of us are also motivated to feel good about ourselves, Smith notes, and look for ways to maintain a positive sense of self. One common way to do this is to compare ourselves to others and find areas where we are better. Similarly, the downfall of others--especially when they have seemed superior to us--can lead to a boost in our self-esteem, a lessening of feelings of inferiority. This is often at the root of <em>schadenfreude.</em> As the author points out, most instances of <em>schadenfreude</em> are harmless, on par with the pleasures of light gossip. Yet we must also be mindful that envy can motivate, without full awareness, the engineering of the misfortune we delight in. And envy-induced aggression can take us into dark territory indeed, as Smith shows as he examines the role of envy and <em>schadenfreude</em> in the Nazi persecution of the Jews.<br><br>Filled with engaging examples of schadenfreude, from popular reality shows to the Duke-Kentucky basketball rivalry, <em>The Joy of Pain</em> provides an intriguing glimpse into a hidden corner of the human psyche.<br></p><p><br><strong>Richard H. Smith</strong> is Professor of Psychology at the University of Kentucky. He has published articles on various social emotions such as envy and shame and has pioneered experimental work on schadenfreude. His book <em>Envy: Theory and Research</em> was published by Oxford University Press in 2008.<br><br>"[An] enjoyable book... worth reading for its insights into the dark side of human nature and the delightful drawings that turn up periodically in the text. Created by the author's daughter, Rosanna Smith, these depictions -- a tortoise raising its arm in victory, Aesop's ant and grasshopper sharing a meal -- give the same sense of delight as those drawings that pepper the pages of <em>The New Yorker</em>." --<em>The New York Times</em><p></p><br>"<em>The Joy of Pain</em> presents an enjoyable mix of evidence from experimental psychology, pop culture and literature." -- <em>Wall Street Journal</em><p></p><br>"Smith's portrait of this complex response combines experimental studies with many well-chosen examples drawn from political scandals, biographies, reality-television shows, literature, sitcoms, cartoons and the observations of comedians and satirists. <em>The Joy of Pain</em> is a real joy to read -- and completely painless." --<em>Nature</em><p></p><br>"Smith's <em>The Joy of Pain: Schadenfreude and the Dark Side of Human Nature</em>, just out from Oxford University Press, is an entertaining explanation of the phenomenon, told through accounts of research as well as Smith's personal experiences and observations of popular culture." --<em>Chronicle Review</em><p></p><br>"An accessible, fun, schadenfreudean romp through pop culture (a contestant embarrasses himself on American Idol), sports (an opponent suffers injury), politics (an economic crisis during the other guy's term), and, of course, religion (the downfall of an ultramoral Christian evangelist)." --<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"Richard Smith's long-awaited book is a profound, thoughtful meditation on one of the most puzzling and disturbing forms of human emotion. Mixing scientific research, popular culture, striking anecdotes, and personal reflection, it is a stimulating, enjoyable, yet unsettling read. I recommend it to anyone with a serious interest in human emotion and motivation -- and to anyone with an abiding curiosity about the peculiar twists and turns of human nature." --Roy F. Baumeister, author of <em>Willpower: Rediscovering the Greatest Human Strength</em><p></p><br>"A very enjoyable read; this is the most comprehensive collection of Schadenfreude research to date. Interweaving the science with historical and fictional anecdotes, Smith contextualizes and thereby humanizes the experience of Schadenfreude -- a feat unto itself. Readers will undoubtedly relish learning more about when and why another's pain can be cause for pleasure." --Mina Cikara, Assistant Professor, Department of Social and Decision Sciences, Carnegie Mellon University<p></p><br>"Richard Smith's wonderful book gives us new insight into ourselves, and the 'dark' emotions of envy and schadenfreude that we all feel, but like to deny. The book is fun and easy to read, even as it gives us insight into some of our darker emotions. You will learn more about yourself and the world from this book than most any book you have read recently. If you want a book that can improve you as a person, this book is it. Although it focuses on dark emotions, it shows the reasons for these emotions, how very pervasive they are, and how they can be overcome." --Ed Diener, Distinguished Professor of Psychology (Emeritus), University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign<p></p><br>"Erudite. Enviable. Engaging stories from popular culture, fiction, history, daily life, sports, and science. This will be the book you wish you had written. But instead of schadenfreude, you will feel admiration and gratitude to the author for his profound contribution." --Susan Fiske, Eugene Higgins Professor, Psychology &amp; Public Affairs, Princeton University, author of <em>Envy Up, Scorn Down</em><p></p><br>"I am grateful that a credible scientist has endeavored to approach this controversial subject. I don't think that I am overreaching when I state that all human beings on earth should understand this concept and acknowledge that it is a part of the human condition, no matter how much we try to deny it. [...] Smith's easy-to-read and entertaining volume begins a dialog that should take place in the United States and around the globe. [...] <em>The Joy of Pain</em> has potential for wide application in academia, particularly the social sciences. However, specialty courses such as ethics in public health and medicine would also benefit from frank discussions of this subject. The text is written in a conversational style, giving it mainstream popular appeal. Every sentient being should read it as an introduction to self-examination." -Tanya Telfair LeBlanc, <em>PsycCRITIQUES</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Teacher&#39;s Survival Guide: Gifted Education</h2><p>Teacher's Survival Guide: Gifted Education is filled with practical information, tips for success, and advice from experienced educators who work with gifted children and youth.

In Oral Sadism and the Vegetarian Personality, readers--professionals and laypeople alike--will encounter tongue-in-cheek articles from the psychological community, including &#34;Psychotherapy of the Dead&#34; and &#34;Etiology and the Treatment of Childhood.&#34; Written in the vernacular of the field, the articles may leave readers wondering if the writers are in earnest, but never doubting that psychologists do, in fact, possess a funny bone!</p><p>Fact: One hundred percent of all dead patients showed a marked reluctance to pay their bills.<br>Fact: Well over half of all Americans alive today have experienced childhood directly, a syndrome marked by a) dwarfism b) knowledge deficits and c) legume anorexia.<br>Fact: When Ms. Cinderella left her glass slipper behind at the stroke of midnight, she was clearly acting in a state of rebellion against the dictatorial regimentation of the domineering fairy godmother.<br>It's true. Members of the psychiatric community are capable of laughter. The Journal of Polymorphous Perversity, the brainchild of psychologist Glenn C. Ellenbogen, has received confirmed reports of uncontrollable outbursts of laughter as the pages of the scholarly parody are sampled.<br>Now patients, professionals, and armchair travelers alike can enjoy the articles that have appeared in this hilarious journal in one hilarious anthology, including such profound and penetrating subjects as "New Improved Delusions," "The Scale of Mental Abilities Requiring Thinking Somewhat (SMARTS)," "Cancer and Tobacco: A Bum Rat," and more.

U.S. geographical and geological surveys of the late nineteenth century produced photographs and drawings of topography, American Indians, geologic features, botanical specimens, and specialists at work in the field. Some of these pictures have long been celebrated for their anticipation of a modernist aesthetic, but Robin Kelsey, in this abundantly illustrated volume, traces their modernistic qualities to archival ingenuity. The technical and promotional needs of surveys, Kelsey argues, fostered the emergence of a taut, graphic pictorial style that imitated the informational clarity of diagrams and maps. As this book demonstrates, these pictures became sites of struggle as well as innovation when three brilliant survey artists and photographers subtly resisted the programs they were hired to serve. Discovering a politics of style behind the modernist look of survey pictures, Kelsey offers a fresh interpretation of canonical western expedition photographs by Timothy H. O&#39;Sullivan and introduces two exceptional but largely forgotten sets of pictures: views of the U.S.-Mexico boundary from the 1850s by Arthur Schott and photographs of the Charleston earthquake of 1886 by C. C. Jones.</p><p>"<i>Archive Style</i> successfully and beautifully reconciles, or rather intertwines, two viewpoints hitherto considered incompatible&#x2015;the logic of the archive and the issue of individual style. Robin Kelsey shows, with great historical rigor, how the styles of illustrators Schott, O'Sullivan, and Jones emerged from the very necessities of survey work and from personal resistance to the social and political structures framing such work. <i>Archive Style</i>, visual history at its best, is a landmark study of nineteenth-century American visual and scientific culture."&#x2015;Fran�ois Brunet, Professor of American Art and Literature, Universit� Paris-Diderot-Paris 7, France<br><br>"In this stunningly original book Robin Kelsey takes a fresh look at nineteenth-century survey prints and photographs. Insisting that the distinctive pictorial style of these pictures emerged in response to particular historical needs, he makes the case for a truly interdisciplinary approach to images. He combines an art historian's attention to artistic innovation with a historian's concern for the larger ambitions of the government surveys, to argue that aesthetic style is the product of both individual talent and larger cultural constraints."&#x2015;Martha A. Sandweiss, Professor of American Studies and History at Amherst College<br><br>"Robin Kelsey's <i>Archive Style</i> is by far the most stimulating, imaginative, and far-reaching study of nineteenth-century American visual culture I have come across in recent years. Drawing upon a wealth of research as well as recent advances in critical theory, Kelsey persuasively reconstructs the historical conditions that in large measure determined the production and reception of survey imagery."&#x2015;Alan Wallach, Professor of Art and Art History and Professor of American Studies, The College of William and Mary<b>Robin Kelsey</b> is John L.

However, the teachers at the boarding school Cheshire Crossing believe them and know that each one of them possesses amazing powers. When the girls' fantasy worlds collide and Captain Hook and the Wicked Witch of the West band together, the three teens must harness their talents to save humanity. Weir, author of the sci-fi book The Martian, and Andersen, known for her funny webcomic Sarah's Scribbles, may seem an unlikely pair, but they pull off this story admirably if not perfectly. The world-hopping is at times confusing, and the character of Nanny is unnecessary. Several swear words and references to sex make the tale more appropriate for a YA audience, though the charming illustrations might attract younger readers. The art is appealing, with eye-catching details. A lovely red poppy motif appears throughout the narrative, and Andersen uses bold colors to depict the fantasy realms. The epilogue hints that the girls' adventures are not done, with another familiar villain ready to take center stage.

The purpose of the short course was to provide a solid introduction to the mathematics underlying the notions of chaos and fractals. The papers in this book range over such topics as dynamical systems theory, Julia sets, the Mandelbrot set, attractors, the Smale horseshoe, calculus on fractals, and applications to data compression. The authors represented here are some of the top experts in this field. Aimed at beginning graduate students, college and university mathematics instructors, and non-mathematics researchers, this book provides readable expositions of several exciting topics of contemporary research.</p><p></p><h2>The Firmament of Time</h2><p>A sensitive exploration of the evolution of man&#39;s scientific awareness of the universe and himself</p><p>The quest to understand humankind's place in the universe is an old one, perhaps as old as the human species itself. That quest is tinged with science, but also with magic, for, writes the paleontologist Loren Eiseley (1907-1977), a human being "is both pragmatist and mystic. He has been so since the beginning, and it may well be that the quality of his inquiring and perceptive intellect will cause him to remain so till the end."<p> In this lively, literate set of essays, originally delivered in 1959 as a lecture series at the University of Cincinnati, Eiseley traces the history of science, giving special attention to the 18th and 19th centuries, which witnessed the rise of a kind of scientific inquiry that crossed narrow disciplines. Building on the ideas of Newton and Laplace, for instance, the Scottish scientist James Hutton developed the foundations of historical geology; Hutton's doctoral work had not been in physics but physiology, and his dissertation concerned the circulation of the blood, from which he evidently hit on the idea of considering the earth as a living organism. Eiseley moves on to discuss trends in evolutionary thought, putting in good words for such neglected figures as Jean Lamarck, a "much maligned thinker [who] glimpsed ecological change and adjustment before Darwin." Eiseley's explorations end with an admonition that our scientific understanding may well have outpaced our moral evolution, leading to the danger that "we have created an unbearable last idol for our worship"--namely, ourselves. His wise words remain compelling reading today. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Loren Eiseley (1907&#x2013;1977), naturalist, essayist, philosopher, and poet, won the John Burroughs Medal for best publication in the field of nature writing in 1961 for <i>The Firmament of Time</i>.&nbsp;Introducer Gary Holthaus, a freelance poet and writer, is the author of <i>Wide Skies: Finding a Home in the West.</i></p><h2>Physics for Scientists and Engineers: Vol. 3 Modern Physics, Quantum Mechanics, Relativity, &amp; the Structure of Matter</h2><p>Book by Tipler, Paul A.</p><p></p><h2>All the Sad Young Men</h2><p>Published a year after The Great Gatsby, this collection of nine short stories by F. Scott Fitzgerald includes two of his most famous - the beautifully elegiac &#39;The Rich Boy&#39; and &#39;Winter Dreams.&#39; Like Gatsby, these two tales feature wealthy protagonists - the old-money Anson Hunter and the self-made man Dexter Green - who struggle to come to terms with lost love. The short story &#39;Absolution&#39;, in which a boy confesses to a priest, was initially written as a background piece to The Great Gatsby.

It includes the powerful and well-known Maccabaean Lecture on Bills of Rights -- a searching critique of Ronald Dworkin's moral-political arguments and conclusions, of the European Court of Human Rights' approach to fundamental rights, and of judicial review as a constitutional institution. It is followed by an equally searching analysis of Kant's thought on the intersection of law, right, and ethics. Other papers in the book's opening section include an early assessment of Rawls's <em>A Theory of</em> <em>Justice</em>, a radical re-interpretation of Aquinas on limited government and the significance of the private/public distinction, and a challenging paper on virtue and the constitution. <br><br>The volume then focuses on central problems in modern political communities, including the achievement of justice in work and distribution; the practice of punishment; war and justice; the public control of euthanasia and abortion; and the nature of marriage and the common good. There are careful and vigorous critiques of Nietzsche on morality, Hart on punishment, Dworkin on the enforcement of morality and on euthanasia, Rawls on justice and law, Thomson on the woman's right to choose, Habermas on abortion, Nussbaum and Koppelman on same-sex relations, and Dummett and Weithman on open borders. <br><br>The volume's previously unpublished papers include a foundational consideration of labor unions, a fresh statement of a new grounding for the morality of sex, a surprising reading of C.S. Lewis's <em>Abolition of Man</em> on contraception, and an introduction reviewing some of the remarkable changes in private and public morality over the past half-century.<br></p><p><br><strong>John Finnis</strong> is Professor of Law and Legal Philosophy at the University of Oxford, and a Fellow of University College.

When first published in 1953, it immediately entered the center of philosophical debate, and achieved a classic status it has retained ever since.

Anscombe (1919 - 2001) to her original English translation. No distribution rights for this book is available outside the USA and North America.</p><p>Presents the philosopher's distillation of two decades of intense work on the philosophies of mind, language, &amp; meaning.Born in Vienna, Ludwig Josef Johann Wittgenstein was educated at Linz and Berlin University. In 1908 he went to England, registering as a research student in engineering at the University of Manchester. There he studied Bertrand Russell&#39;s (see also Vol. 5) Principles of Mathematics by chance and decided to study with Russell at Cambridge University. From 1912 to 1913, he studied under Russell&#39;s supervision and began to develop the ideas that crystallized in his Tractatus. With the outbreak of World War I, he returned home and volunteered for the Austrian Army. During his military service, he prepared the book published in 1921 as the Tractatus, first translated into English in 1922 by C. K. Ogden. Wittgenstein emerged as a philosopher whose influence spread from Austria to the English-speaking world. Perhaps the most eminent philosopher during the second half of the twentieth century, Wittgenstein had an early impact on the members of the Vienna Circle, with which he was associated. The logical atomism of the Tractatus, with its claims that propositions of logic and mathematics are tautologous and that the cognitive meaning of other sorts of scientific statements is empirical, became the fundamental source of logical positivism, or logical empiricism. Bertrand Russell adopted it as his position, and A. J. Ayer was to accept and profess it 15 years later. From the end of World War I until 1926, Wittgenstein was a schoolteacher in Austria. In 1929 his interest in philosophy renewed, and he returned to Cambridge, where even G. E. Moore came under his spell. At Cambridge Wittgenstein began a new wave in philosophical analysis distinct from the Tractatus, which had inspired the rise of logical positivism. Whereas the earlier Wittgenstein had concentrated on the formal structures of logic and mathematics, the later Wittgenstein attended to the fluidities of ordinary language. His lectures, remarks, conversations, and letters made lasting imprints on the minds of his most brilliant students, who have long since initiated the unending process of publishing them. During his lifetime Wittgenstein himself never published another book after the Tractatus. However, he was explicit that the work disclosing the methods and topics of his later years be published.

Watkins describes cases where the mixing of indigenous values and archaeological practice has worked well&#x2015;and some in which it hasn't&#x2015;both in the United States and around the globe. He surveys the attitudes of archaeologists toward American Indians through an inventive series of of hypothetical scenarios, with some eye-opening results. And he calls for the development of Indigenous Archaeology, in which native peoples are full partners in the key decisions about heritage resources management as well as the practice of it. Watkins' book is an important contribution in the contemporary public debates in public archaeology, applied anthropology, cultural resources management, and Native American studies.</p><p>Joe Watkins is an anthropologist at University of New Mexico and a member of the Choctaw tribe. He has a Ph.D. in archaeology from Southern Methodist University.Dr. Watkins is to be commended for his thorough research and even-handed presentation of the facts and issues in a debate that sparks emotion on both sides. (Stacye Hathorn, Alabama Historical Commission)<br><br>This important book offers a unique lens on archaeology and its practitioners. Native American archaeologist Joe Watkins gives us a penetrating analysis of what archaeologists think about themselves and their subject, framed by his inimitable wit and tact. <i>Indigenous Archaeology</i> is a must-read for anyone interested in the future of archaeology as a profession. (K Anne Pyburn, (Indiana University))<br><br>Joe Watkins draws upon his experience and expertise as a federal archaeologist and a Choctaw to address Native American sensitivities and the modern practices of archaeology.

Underlining how public perception of acupuncture has shifted over the last few decades from one of skepticism to one of acceptance, he explores the progression of acupuncture research from its unsuccessful beginnings to the ultimate discovery of a scientific basis for therapies centered on the subtle coherence patterns of interacting electromagnetic waves and fields. He explains the dissipative structure of electromagnetic waves that constitutes our electromagnetic body and describes how changes in our mood, lifestyle, and environment affect it.<br><br> <i>Invisible Rainbow</i> explains these developments within the context of science's parallel development from its nineteenth-century focus on materialism, reductionism, and closed systems to its realization of the mass-energy equivalence, electromagnetic field, and its study of open complex systems. Discussing differences in Eastern and Western thought traditions and how they influence their respective medical systems, it also elucidates acupuncture's meridian system and Ayurveda's chakras and auras.</p><p>Changlin Zhang, a Chinese-trained physicist who studies the electromagnetic field in human bodies and in other living systems, has more than thirty years experience in medical research in China and Germany. He has published numerous papers in physics, biology, and medical journals in China, Germany, the UK, the U.S., and Switzerland, and he is the editor-in-chief of the International Journal of Physiotherapy and Life Physics.

He has practiced Taoist qigong for twelve years."Zhang presents proof from the field of natural science and succeeds in demonstrating that the whole material world does not exist in disjunction, but is wrapped together, expressed through an ocean of electromagnetic waves that together determine the functional courses of all living beings."<br>&#x2014;Dr. Gerd Schnack, professor of sports medicine and president of the German Assocation of Preventive Medicine<br><br>"No other nonmedical book is as attractive to me as this one.

Medically, the human material has to be kept functioning as long as possible to secure maximum medical and economic profit. As a biophysicist, Zhang opens our eyes to all the invisible, and our ears to all the inaudible reality that surrounds us, which we like to exclude from our views in order to keep our world as easy to control and grasp as we like it."<br>&#x2014;Hans-Joachim Hahn, founder and organizer of Professorenforum, an organization of German professors<br><br>"Many people will enjoy reading this book and benefit from it in various aspects."<br>&#x2014;Ruixiang Chen, professor at Beijing University of Chinese Medicine<br><br>"The author, Professor Changlin Zhang, describes the acu-points and acu-meridians through a physics lens, with vivid language, proficient knowledge, and profound insight into modern physics."<br>&#x2014;Guozhen Chen, professor of physics, Dongwu Unviersity, Taiwan</p><h2>Phenomenology and Psychological Research</h2><p>This book is both a theoretical justification of a phenomenological and human scientific approach to psychological research and a presentation of findings in the areas of cognitive, clinical, and social psychology.The book is important because it is the most sustained statement to date about a phenomenological approach to psychological research along with original findings to compare with mainstream psychology in crucial areas of psychology: cognitive, clinical, and social psychology.Phenomenology and Psychological Research is further clarification of the phenomenological approach to psychological research along with examples of application in four different content areas: learning and thinking (both examples of alternative approaches to cognitive processes), self-deception (clinical psychology), and criminal victimization (social psychology). As such, it gives the reader who is merely curious about the possibilities of phenomenological approaches a good opportunity to evaluate its fruitfulness, whereas those who are already sympathetic to the approach will find a greater articulation of the theory behind the procedures. Lastly, the reader will find in this study an example of a descriptive and qualitative approach to psychological research that claims to meet both phenomenological and human scientific criteria. It is one of the first books to make such a claim about psychological research.</p><p>Amedeo Giorgi, Editor</p><h2>The Birth of a New Physics</h2><p><p><strong>The earth circles the sun every year and rotates on its axis every twenty-four hours. The earth does not stand still.</strong></p> These are notions so basic to our view of life that we take them for granted. But in the seventeenth century they were revolutionary, heretical, even dangerous to the men who formed them. Culture, religion, and science had intertwined over the centuries to create a world view based on a stationary earth. Indeed, if the earth moved, would not birds be blown off the trees and would not an object thrown straight up come down far away?<br><br> Then came the Renaissance and with it Copernicus, Galileo, Kepler, Huygens, and Newton: giants who courageously remade the world into an earth which actually moves 100,000 feet a second while revolving 1,000 miles an hour around an object 93,000,000 miles away.

John Rockwell shows how it relates to the other two films in the &#34;Good Woman&#34; trilogy, as well as von Trier&#39;s Danish television work and his direction of Wagner&#39;s &#34;Ring&#34; cycle at the Bayreuth Festival.</p><p>Lars von Trier was the wunderkind of European cinema in the 1990s, a guiding light of the Dogme 95 movement, and a filmmaker who, more than any of his peers, divided critics and spectators. In keeping with Dogme principles, &#34;The Idiots&#34; (1998) was shot with a hand-held camera, without ornamental music and on real locations. Set in a commune, the film sparked great controversy for showing a group of young people in search of their &#34;inner idiots&#34;. Yet it moved many in its patent concern for showing people in primal states and the tragedies that precipitate and result from those states. As well as being a Dogme film &#34;The Idiots&#34; is quintessential von Trier and, in John Rockwell&#39;s view, perhaps his most powerful work. It forms a trilogy - the &#34;Good Woman&#34; trilogy - with &#34;Breaking the Waves&#34; (1996) and &#34;Dancer in the Dark&#34; (2000). Rockwell shows how &#34;The Idiots&#34; relates to the other two films in addition to von Trier&#39;s celebrated early work in Danish television and his foray into directing Wagner&#39;s &#34;Ring&#34; cycle at the Bayreuth Festival.

Power (1872-1951) was a leading member of the Grosvenor School of Modern Art in London in the 1920s and 1930s under the inspirational leadership of Claude Flight. Flight&#39;s Grosvenor School artists were responsible for the remarkable rise of the colour linocut print during this period, and their significance as a major contribution to modern British art between the wars has not yet been fully and widely appreciated. This book assesses Cyril Power&#39;s achievement as a dynamic avant-garde printmaker, and shows how in his work the potential of linocut printmaking as a semi-abstract language was realised to an impressively original degree.It is the first book to establish Power as an extraordinarily creative printmaker in his own right, cataloguing and illustrating in colour for the first time all 46 of his linocuts. Philip Vann traces the many sources for Power&#39;s work: the linocuts of the German Expressionists, the inspiring influence of the Italian Futurists, Vorticist prints and paintings, and works by Mark Gertler, Frantisek Kupka and Duchamp, as well as contemporary literature and film. &#34;Cyril Power Linocuts&#34; will be an essential resource for all those with a specialist or amateur interest in the vibrant prints of this period.</p><p>Philip Vann is a writer on the visual arts for publications including The Economist, Galleries, RA Magazine, Resurgence and World of Interiors.

Gellman&#x2019;s exhaustively researched work is the definitive account of Richard Nixon&#x2019;s rise from political unknown to the verge of achieving the vice-presidency. To document Nixon&#x2019;s congressional career, Gellman combed the files of Nixon&#x2019;s 1946, 1948, and 1950 campaigns, papers from the executive sessions of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), and every document dated through 1952 at the Richard Nixon Library.<br> &nbsp;<br> This singular volume corrects many earlier written accounts. For example, there was no secret funding of Nixon&#x2019;s senate campaign in 1950, and Nixon won universal praise for his evenhandedness as a member of HUAC. The first book of a projected five-volume examination of this complex man&#x2019;s entire career, this work stands as the definitive political portrait of Nixon as a fast-rising young political star.</p><p><b>Irwin F. Gellman</b> is an independent scholar and the author of five books on American presidents. He lives in Parkesburg, PA.A meticulously researched revisionist account (the first volume of a projected three) of Richard Nixon's public career, from a Putitzer-winning author (Secret Affairs, not reviewed). After Nixons resignation from the presidency in 1974, it was popular to argue that the character flaws that emerged in the Watergate crisis were evident in his first political campaigns and his tenure as a congressman and senator. Not so, contends Gellman (Modern American History/Chapman Coll.). Basing his conclusions on Nixon's recently declassified personal papers, Gellman concludes that the popular image of Nixon as a ruthless liar and conniver who rose to national prominence through irresponsible Red-baiting is actually a myth. Instead, Gellman argues, Nixon was ``a success story in a troubled era, one who steered a sensible anticommunist course against the excess of McCarthy and other extreme right-wingers.'' Charges, still widely believed, that Nixon smeared Jerry Voorhis in his 1946 congressional campaign and Helen Gahagan Douglas in his 1950 Senate campaign are false, Gellman asserts, born of partisanship and unfairness. Instead, both campaigns were divisive but ``hard-fought and deeply emotional'' on both sides. Gellman traces Nixon's involvement in the Hiss-Chambers case, which first brought him national prominence, his rapid rise in the national GOP organization as a senator who focused on the issues of communism and the Korean War, and the 1952 nominating convention in which he suddenly emerged as a dark horse vice-presidential candidate. Arguing that Nixon's nomination was the culmination of several political forces, including the high profile Nixon earned in the Hiss case, Gellman counters the widespread notion that Nixon manipulated his way to the 1952 nomination. Nixon had no managers, he points out, and Dwight Eisenhower had expressed interest in capturing the vote of young people with a youthful running mate. The 39-year-old Nixon seemed to fit the billhe was ``young, patriotic, articulate, and dependable,'' and in Ike's view became the logical choice for the ticket. A substantial contribution to Nixon scholarship. -- <i>Copyright �1999, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Heal Your Hips explores an unprecedented range of preventive options you can take today to avoid hip injury and improve your hip health--including wonderful water and land exercises and intensive stretching. Numerous illustrations help you understand the structure and function of your hips, and dozens of photographs clearly demonstrate how to do the exercises. If indeed hip surgery is in your future, Heal Your Hips provides vital new information on several little-known, minimally invasive forms of surgery as well as straightforward coverage of traditional &#34;&#34;replacement&#34;&#34; surgery. You&#39;ll learn what to expect with hip surgery--from preparing for the procedure to the day of the operation to returning home and recovering with physical therapy. The practical and long-overdue guidance in Heal Your Hips will be a revelation for the millions enduring the pain of hip deterioration and injury. Whether you or your loved ones are considering hip surgery or have yet to seek medical help, turn first to the indispensable expertise in this optimistic and accessible resource.</p><p>Orthopedic surgeon Robert Klapper, M.D., <i>loves</i> to operate, but he'd rather help you avoid hip surgery. Klapper, Medical Director of Cedars-Sinai Orthopedic Associates, has teamed up with Lynda Huey, who specializes in water rehabilitation and training programs with clients such as Wilt Chamberlain. In <i>Heal Your Hips</i>, they present a self-help program for pain relief. The first program consists of 13 illustrated exercises, one minute apiece. Eight are done in the pool; the others in a carpeted room. Next, the authors cover healthy and unhealthy hips in a clear and spirited style (e.g., healthy hips work like two ice cubes rubbing together--slippery, with no friction); the main causes of hip problems; and medical tests. You learn how to take an active role in getting the right diagnosis, what to do for less pain, and how to get started with pool exercise. Then the book presents both deep-water and shallow-water aquatic therapy exercises to avoid or recuperate from hip surgery, and stretches to do on land. If you have had hip surgery or you want to avoid it, this book will be a valuable guide. The book is clearly illustrated with photographs. <i>--Joan Price</i>ROBERT KLAPPER, M.D., is Medical Director of Cedars-Sinai Orthopedic Associates and a clinical assistant professor of orthopedic surgery at the University of Southern California.

As Downing's partner, and after Downing's death in 1852, Vaux designed country and suburban dwellings that were remarkable for their well-conceived plans and their sensitive rapport with nature.<br> By 1857, the year he published his book <em>Villas and Cottages</em>, Vaux had moved to New York City. There he asked Frederick Law Olmsted to join him in preparing a design for Central Park. He spent the next 38 years defending and refining their vision of Central Park as a work of art. After the Civil War, he and Olmsted led the nascent American park movement with their designs for parks and parkways in Brooklyn, Buffalo, and many other American cities.<br> Apart from undertakings with Olmsted, Vaux cultivated a distinguished architectural practice. Among his clients were the artist Frederic Church, whose dream house, Olana, he helped create; and the reform politician Samuel Tilden, whose residence on New York's Gramercy Park remains one of the country's outstanding Victorian buildings. A pioneering advocate for apartment houses in American cities, Vaux designed buildings that mirrored the advance of urbanization in America, including early model housing for the poor. He planned the original portions of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History and conceived a stunning proposal for a vast iron and glass building to house the Centennial Exhibition in Philadelphia. Especially notable are the many bridges and other charming structures that he designed for Central Park. Vaux considered the Park's Terrace, decorated by J. W. Mould, as his greatest achievement.<br> An active participant in the cultural and intellectual life of New York, Vaux was an idealist who regarded himself as an artist and a professional. And while much has been written on Olmsted, comparatively little has been published about Vaux. The first in-depth account of Vaux's career, <em>Country,</em> <em>Park, and City</em> should be of great interest to historians of art, architecture, and urbanism, as well as preservationists and other readers interested in New York City's past and America's first parks.<br></p><p>Ask the average New Yorker who designed Central Park, and those who know their history will probably say Frederick Law Olmstead--and they would be partially correct. But ask for the other half of the designing duo and watch for the blank stares. Notoriously introverted, Calvert Vaux left a legacy that, along with Central Park, includes Prospect Park in Brooklyn, original portions of both the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the American Museum of Natural History, as well as many other New York landmarks, yet most people outside of the architectural field have never heard of him. In <i>Country, Park, &amp; City: The Architecture and Life of Calvert Vaux</i>, Francis R. Kowsky succeeds in rescuing Vaux from obscurity. In setting the record straight, Kowsky describes how Vaux originally approached Olmstead to join him in entering the design competition for Central Park in 1857, and after they won, the more charismatic Olmstead was recognized as the force behind the plan, while Vaux kept to the shadows.

Elinor Dashwood takes a practical, rational attitude toward romance that contrasts sharply with the impulsive nature and idealistic views of her younger sister, Marianne. With keen observations and sparkling wit, Austen recounts the Dashwood sisters' struggles to balance passion with prudence.&nbsp;<br>This portrait of life in a nineteenth-century English village depicts a world in which matters of the heart are complicated by issues of money, class, and public opinion&#x2014;a world not too different from our own. Readers will treasure this keepsake edition of Austen's classic, which features more than&nbsp;sixty&nbsp;eloquent pen-and-ink drawings by a leading illustrator of the Victorian era, as well as the original Introduction by Joseph Jacobs.</p><p>Though not the first novel she wrote, <i>Sense and Sensibility</i> was the first Jane Austen published. Though she initially called it <i>Elinor and Marianne</i>, Austen jettisoned both the title and the epistolary mode in which it was originally written, but kept the essential theme: the necessity of finding a workable middle ground between passion and reason. The story revolves around the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne. Whereas the former is a sensible, rational creature, her younger sister is wildly romantic--a characteristic that offers Austen plenty of scope for both satire and compassion. Commenting on Edward Ferrars, a potential suitor for Elinor's hand, Marianne admits that while she "loves him tenderly," she finds him disappointing as a possible lover for her sister: <blockquote> Oh! Mama, how spiritless, how tame was Edward's manner in reading to us last night! I felt for my sister most severely. Yet she bore it with so much composure, she seemed scarcely to notice it. I could hardly keep my seat. To hear those beautiful lines which have frequently almost driven me wild, pronounced with such impenetrable calmness, such dreadful indifference! </blockquote> Soon however, Marianne meets a man who measures up to her ideal: Mr. Willoughby, a new neighbor. So swept away by passion is Marianne that her behavior begins to border on the scandalous. Then Willoughby abandons her; meanwhile, Elinor's growing affection for Edward suffers a check when he admits he is secretly engaged to a childhood sweetheart. How each of the sisters reacts to their romantic misfortunes, and the lessons they draw before coming finally to the requisite happy ending forms the heart of the novel. Though Marianne's disregard for social conventions and willingness to consider the world well-lost for love may appeal to modern readers, it is Elinor whom Austen herself most evidently admired; a truly happy marriage, she shows us, exists only where sense and sensibility meet and mix in proper measure. <i>--Alix Wilber</i>Jane Austen&#39;s first published novel introduced many of the themes which would dominate Austen&#39;s future work. Austen writes about everyday events of her own time with a subtlety and sensitivity unprecedented in the English novel.

Most of the novel is set in London, but many important events throughout the story occur in Sudan or India. The Light that Failed follows the life of Dick Heldar, a painter who goes blind. A play by George Fleming, starring Johnston Forbes-Robertson, his wife Gertrude Elliott, and Sydney Valentine, was first staged in the West End from February to April 1903[1] and moved on to Broadway in November, making the story more famous.It was made into a 1916 silent film by Path�, with Robert Edeson and Jose Collins, a 1923 silent film by Famous Players-Lasky, and a 1939 film by Paramount, starring Ronald Colman as Heldar, with Muriel Angelus, Ida Lupino, and Walter Huston............ Joseph Rudyard Kipling ( 30 December 1865 &#x2013; 18 January 1936) was an English journalist, short-story writer, poet, and novelist. Kipling's works of fiction include The Jungle Book (1894), Kim (1901), and many short stories, including "The Man Who Would Be King" (1888). His poems include "Mandalay" (1890), "Gunga Din" (1890), "The Gods of the Copybook Headings" (1919), "The White Man's Burden" (1899), and "If&#x2014;" (1910). He is regarded as a major innovator in the art of the short story; his children's books are classics of children's literature; and one critic described his work as exhibiting "a versatile and luminous narrative gift". Kipling was one of the most popular writers in the United Kingdom, in both prose and verse, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Henry James said: "Kipling strikes me personally as the most complete man of genius, as distinct from fine intelligence, that I have ever known." In 1907, at the age of 42, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Literature, making him the first English-language writer to receive the prize, and its youngest recipient to date.He was also sounded out for the British Poet Laureateship and on several occasions for a knighthood, both of which he declined. Kipling's subsequent reputation has changed according to the political and social climate of the age and the resulting contrasting views about him continued for much of the 20th century.George Orwell called him a "prophet of British imperialism".Literary critic Douglas Kerr wrote: "[Kipling] is still an author who can inspire passionate disagreement and his place in literary and cultural history is far from settled. But as the age of the European empires recedes, he is recognised as an incomparable, if controversial, interpreter of how empire was experienced. That, and an increasing recognition of his extraordinary narrative gifts, make him a force to be reckoned with."</p><p><b>Rudyard Kipling</b> was born in Bombay in 1865. During his time at the United Services College, he began to write poetry, privately publishing <b>Schoolboy Lyrics</b> in 1881. The following year he started work as a journalist in India, and while there produced a body of work, stories, sketches, and poems including Mandalay, Gunga Din, and Danny Deeverwhich made him an instant literary celebrity when he returned to England in 1889. While living in Vermont with his wife, an American, Kipling wrote <b>The Jungle Books</b>, <b>Just So Stories</b>, and <b>Kim</b>which became widely regarded as his greatest long work, putting him high among the chronicles of British expansion. Kipling returned to England in 1902, but he continued to travel widely and write, though he never enjoyed the literary esteem of his early years. In 1907, he became the first British writer to be awarded the Nobel Prize. He died in 1936Novel by Rudyard Kipling, published in 1890. The book, which includes autobiographical elements, describes the youth and manhood of Dick Heldar and traces his efforts as a war correspondent and artist whose sketches of British battles in the Sudan become popular. When he returns to London, he begins painting his masterpiece, racing against time because a battle wound has caused his eyesight to progressively fail. Kipling wrote two separate endings to The Light That Failed, a happy ending for the version published in Lippincott's Monthly Magazine in January 1890 and an unhappy ending for the version published in book form a few months later. -- <i>The Merriam-Webster Encyclopedia of Literature</i></p><h2>An Anthology of Western Marxism: From Luk�cs and Gramsci to Socialist-Feminism</h2><p>This unique anthology brings together readings from the works of the most significant post-Leninist Marxist thinkers.

The book begins with a series of ecological questions that can be answered by experiments, such as: what is the importance of competition among scientists? The minimal requirements of experimental design that should be met for satisfactory field experiments are then introduced, and examples of good and poor experiments from the literature are examined in this light along with a consideration of the trade-offs that may be forced on the experiment by the conditions faced in the field. Included are descriptions of experiments in five different kinds of environments: forests, successional habitats, deserts and semideserts, fresh water (divided into lakes, ponds, and streams), and marine environments (divided according to the kind of substrate). Each experiment is discussed from the standpoint of the ecological question being answered and the quality of ecological design. For most of the environments, the experiments are arranged according to the topic level. The final chapter contains discussions of the results in the different environments, and the conclusions that the experiments in each environment permit. It is shown that interpretations of environmental phenomena must be different for each kind of environment, and that a general theory of ecology is unlikely to be obtainable.</p><p>Experiments in five different kinds of environments--forests, successional habitats, deserts and semideserts, fresh water and marine environments--are analyzed from the perspective of manipulative field experimentation in ecology.fm.author_biographical_note1</p><h2>2001 German and English Idioms (2001 Idioms Series)</h2><p>Two separate alphabetical listings give definitions in German-to-English, and English-to-German.

She describes the historical background to the geographical spread of Buddhism, and examines the way in which some meditative practices developed as this process occurred. Other chapters cover basic meditative practice, types of meditation, meditation in different regions, meditation and doctrine, and the role of chanting within meditation.</p> <p>Although not a practical guide, <em>An Introduction to Buddhist Meditation</em>&nbsp;outlines the procedures associated with Buddhist practices and suggests appropriate activities, useful both for students and interested Buddhists.

In this book, Colin Cremin tackles the overbearing truth that capitalism encompasses the totality of our social relations, having woven itself deeply into the fabric of what it means to be human. He shows how the capitalist system totalizes everything in its path, as evidenced in industrialized warfare, modern surveillance, commodification, and political control. With ever deepening social crises and ecological catastrophes this system threatens civilization as we know it. But among the wreckage of capitalism, Cremin argues, we can still find functioning parts, machines to be salvaged. To do so, it is imperative that we be able to both imagine and realize a future other than the apocalypticism forewarned by scientists, prescribed by economists, accommodated by politicians, and made into spectacle by the entertainment industry.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Totalled</i> maps the deteriorating socio-economic, political, and ecological conditions in which we live. Yet Cremin asks how a utopian possibility discernable in the power of human creation can be realized even though as a society we are bound up materially, ideologically, libidinally&#x2014;totally&#x2014;to the capitalist machine of destruction. <i>Totalled </i>concludes with a politically and economically grounded set of propositions on how we might begin to imagine such a possibility.</p><p><b>Colin Cremin </b>is author of <i>Capitalism&#x2019;s New Clothes: Enterprise, Ethics and Enjoyment in Times of Crisis</i> and <i>iCommunism</i>.

It is lucidly and powerfully argued and constitutes a significant achievement. The authors sensibly argue that in order to fully understand and explain drug use and abuse it is necessary to take into account different levels of analysis, reflecting distinct domains of human functioning; the biological, psychosocial, and cultural-historical....Overall, this book represents an exceptional achievement and should be of interest to drug clinicians and researcher as well as social scientists and students."--Professor Tony Ward, University of Melbourne Substance use and abuse are two of the most frequent psychological problems clinicians encounter. Mainstream approaches focus on the biological and psychological factors supporting drug abuse. But to fully comprehend the issue, clinicians need to consider the social, historical, and cultural factors responsible for drug-related problems.&nbsp;Substance Use and Abuse: Cultural and Historical Perspectives provides an inclusive explanation of the human desire to take drugs. Using a multidisciplinary framework, authors Russil Durrant and Jo Thakker explore the cultural and historical variables that contribute to drug use. Integrating biological, psychosocial, and cultural-historical perspectives, this innovative and accessible volume addresses the fundamental question of why drug use is such a ubiquitous feature of human society.&nbsp;Addressing issues important to prevention, treatment, and public policy, the authors includeA comprehensive, historical survey of drug useAn exploration of the evolutionary basis of drug-taking behaviorHistorically and culturally based explanations of drug use and abuseInclusive approaches that complement mainstream biopsychosocial perspectives&nbsp;Designed for upper-division undergraduate and graduate students in</p><p><p>Russil Durrant received his Ph.D. from the University of Canterbury, where he also ompleted a Post Doctoral Fellowship.

Starting at the beginning of the twentieth century, when there were very few international organizations in existence, <i>A World Beyond Borders</i> traces the growth of IOs through to the close of the century, when there were literally thousands at the heart of the international system. </p> <br><br><p>Following this chronological order, the book examines how international organizations became the major legal, moral, and cultural forces that they are today, involved in all aspects of international relations including peacekeeping, disarmament, peace resolution, human rights, diplomacy, and environmentalism. </p><br><br><p>This book is the first in the Canadian Historical Association / University of Toronto Press International Themes and Issues Series, which is dedicated to publishing concise, focused overviews of topics that are of international significance in the study of history. </p></p><p><b>David MacKenzie</b> is a professor in the Department of History at Ryerson University.<br>This lucid, thoughtful synthesis makes excellent sense of the dense web that international organizations have spun around the globe over the last two centuries. Above all, by highlighting their role in relation to states and by assessing their performance, this volume provides a welcome introduction to a prime feature of our globalized world. (Michael H. Hunt, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill)<br><br>The author has written a balanced, fair introduction to the modern history of international organizations. While the survey of the League of Nations is well-done, the book really comes alive with its analysis of the United Nations. The final chapter, surveying recent UN operations, is excellent. <i>A World Beyond Borders</i> is an effective resource for undergraduate students of international relations.

The author, an experienced grower, has discovered that catasetums require very different cultural techniques from most orchids, but if the plants&#39; particular needs are observed, they are not difficult to grow successfully. Among the traits that lend particular interest to the genus is the almost explosive release of pollen, a kind of conservatory parlor trick that delights the grower and surprises the unwary.</p><p>Catasetum is a genus of Central &amp; South American orchids, strikingly beautiful but somewhat neglected by hobbyists. The author, an experienced grower, details techniques for successful cultivation.World of Catasetums is not a monograph, per se, but as Holst describes it, a growers helpmate. Thus, it is comparatively light on taxonomy (although taxonomy is certainly not absent!) and instead focuses on issues that growers find pertinent, such as identification and culture with a little history thrown in. Holst provides very practical how-to advice about catasteum culture, with special attention to potting methods but also important information about dividing, fertilizing, watering, temperature, light, humidity and air movement, and pests and diseases. The key to determining what your catasetum needs is knowing the ecological zone from which the species originated, and Holst divides the Central and South America into five zones, explaining each zone carefully, and providing a map to give a general idea of catasetums origins. These zones recur throughout the book, linking the extensive plant listings to the cultural information. The bulk of this book is devoted to descriptions of the species, with the 68 that Holst knows best accorded full-blown descriptions. Additional chapters cover fragrance and breeding, accompanied by 89 stunning color photos of catasetums.

While some would protest, it&#39;s true that his distinctive, comics-inspired lines, his American themes and his enigmatic eroticism had a striking influence on both Pop and a younger generation. This retrospective covers 45 years of stylistically consistent work, from before Pop to after it, including some 100 drawings and gouaches from Wesley&#39;s own studio and from private collections, organized in a first attempt to shed light on this wide-ranging oeuvre in terms of the processes by which it came into being, and to analyze the incongruous profundity of the results. Wesley&#39;s paintings, although they refer to downmarket aesthetics and mundane American life, nonetheless have an exceptionally meditative, even spiritual effect: they wrest from the ordinary all the big themes that have played in occidental figurative painting, including passion, love, hate, greed, failure, malice, self-importance and dreams, as well as an entirely contemporary ambiguity and humor.

She lives in Dekalb, Illinois.Grade 9 Up&#x2014;This adaptation of Flannery's 2005 adult publication shows the results of meticulous research and superb grounding in scientific facts. It lays out, in great detail, the ways in which humans have changed our weather and the possible outcomes for us and our planet if we continue as we are going. Clearly labeled illustrations accompany difficult concepts and greatly aid in understanding the sometimes-complicated climate models. Each chapter ends with a "Call to Action" describing how humans can make relatively simple changes in our lifestyle to reduce our impact on the planet. Yet, despite the many great aspects of this book, one issue clearly reduces its usefulness. The research and issues surrounding global warming are changing at an incredible pace and the adaptation presented here, while doing some updates, is not sufficiently current. For example, Chapter 22 covers the Kyoto Protocol, which, though mightily relevant in 2005, is being eclipsed by the upcoming Copenhagen (December 2009) conference, where the United States is poised to play a much more involved role. The Copenhagen Climate Conference is not mentioned. Some of the research on animals (harp seals, for example) that are endangered does not update past 2005. Additionally, the sections entitled "Call to Action" are often aimed at adults rather than teens. Not many teens will be weatherproofing their homes, checking water heaters, or buying new appliances&#x2014;just yet anyway&#x2014;and this disconnect is jarring.&#x2014;<i>Denise Schmidt, San Francisco Public Library, CA</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kuyper introduces Calvinism as a life-system, discussing its relationship to religion, politics, science, and art. According to Kuyper, Calvinism seeks to unify the cosmos under universal laws. For instance, he states that predestination proves that a set of laws exists to govern the world, and science is merely trying to figure them out. Kuyper defends Calvinism in the realm of art as well, providing a thorough and elegant explanation of this outlook on life. The collection is called Lectures on Calvinism and not lectures on Christianity because Kuyper believed that Calvinism most truthfully and most completely articulates the Biblical Christian faith.<br></p><p><b>HENDRICKSON CHRISTIAN CLASSICS</b><br> Hendrickson Christian Classics is intended to include all the timeless books that generations of believers have treasured. Each volume in the series is freshly typeset, while thoughtful new prefaces explore their spiritual and historical contexts. For contemporary readers, here is an essential library of Christian wisdom through the ages.<b>Dr. Abraham Kuyper</b> (18371920) was a Dutch Calvinist theologian, philosopher, and politician. As leader of the Anti-Revolutionary Party in the Netherlands, he served as Prime Minister of his country from 19011905. He occupied himself with the task of reconstructing the social structures of his native land on the basis of its Calvinistic heritage in almost every area of life. He developed Neo-Calvinism, which emphasizes the sovereignty of Jesus over all mental pursuits and supports the idea that there is a grace given by God to all things in order to sustain the continued unfolding of creation. Kuyper wrote a number of books, including <i>Conservatism and Orthodoxy</i> (1870), <i>The Social Question and the Christian Religion</i> (1891), and <i>Common Grace</i> (1902).</p><h2>Autonomy Is in Our Hearts: Zapatista Autonomous Government through the Lens of the Tsotsil Language (Kairos)</h2><p>Following the Zapatista uprising on New Year&#x2019;s Day 1994, the EZLN communities of Chiapas began the slow process of creating a system of autonomous government that would bring their call for freedom, justice, and democracy from word to reality. <i>Autonomy Is in Our Hearts</i> analyzes this long and arduous process on its own terms, using the conceptual language of Tsotsil, a Mayan language indigenous to the highland Zapatista communities of Chiapas. The words &#x201c;Freedom,&#x201d; &#x201c;Justice,&#x201d; and &#x201c;Democracy&#x201d; emblazoned on the Zapatista flags are only approximations of the aspirations articulated in the six indigenous languages spoken by the Zapatista communities. They are rough translations of concepts such as ichbail ta muk&#x2019; or &#x201c;mutual recognition and respect among equal persons or peoples,&#x201d; a&#x2019;mtel or &#x201c;collective work done for the good of a community&#x201d; and lekil kuxlejal or &#x201c;the life that is good for everyone.&#x201d; <i>Autonomy Is in Our Hearts </i>provides a fresh perspective on the Zapatistas and a deep engagement with the daily realities of Zapatista autonomous government.</p><p><b>Dylan Fitzwater</b> has encountered the Zapatistas as a human rights observer, a participant in several international gatherings, and as a student at the Zapatista language school in Oventik.

It stands out from the rest of the Anglophone literature in that it demonstrates, with great sensitivity, how a dialectic between traditional culture and institutions and emerging revolutionary and regenerative forces can play a crucial role in liberatory social transformation. It shows us what we can learn from the indigenous people of Chiapas about a politics of community, care, and mutual aid, and&#x2014;to use a word that they themselves use so much&#x2014;about a politics of heart. A great strength of the work is that the author is a very good listener. He allows the people of Chiapas to tell their own story largely in their own words, and with their own distinctive voice.&#x201d; &#x2014;John P.

As always, Brody confronts central questions, both substantive and historiographical, focusing primarily on the efforts of laboring people to assert some control over their working lives, and on the equal determination of American business to conserve the prerogatives of management. Long a classic in the field of American labor history, valued by general readers and specialists alike for its brilliance of argument and clarity of style, <em>Workers in Industrial</em> <em>America</em> is now more timely than ever.<br></p><p>David Brody is at University of California, Davis."I like the combination of events and theory, as well as the 20th century focus."--Robert Rusnak, Rosary College<br><br>Praise for the first edition: "Anything that Brody writes is required reading for students of American labor history. It is a great advantage to have Brody's pathbreaking previously published essays collected under one cover."--Robert H. Zieger, Wayne State University<br><br>"Thorough, sober, and persuasive."--David Montgomery, Yale University<br><br>"A rare treat....Taken together, these essays certainly confirm Professor Brody's reputation as the leading historian of the modern American labor movement, one well able to stand among such earlier greats in the field as John R. Commons and Selig Perlman."--Melvyn Dubofsky, State University<br>of New York, Binghamton<br><br>"The second edition adds two new essays to an already splendid volume that should continue to interest historians, students, and others who are interested in working-class struggles in this century, and in the current crisis of the labor movement."--Michael A.

Now reaching its four hundredth anniversary, it remains one of the most frequently used Bibles in the English-speaking world, especially in America.<br> <br>Lavishly illustrated with reproductions from early editions of the KJB, <em>Bible: The Story of the King James Version</em> offers a vivid and authoritative history of this renowned translation, ranging from the Bible's inception to the present day. Gordon Campbell, a leading authority on Renaissance literatures, tells the engaging and complex story of how this translation came to be commissioned, who the translators were, and how the translation was accomplished. Campbell does not end with the printing of that first edition, but also traces the textual history from 1611 to the establishment of the modern text by Oxford University Press in 1769, shedding light on the subsequent generations who edited and interacted with the text and bringing to life the controversies surrounding later revisions. In addition, the author examines the reception of the King James Version, showing how its popularity has shifted through time and territory, ranging from adulation to deprecation and attracting the attention of a wide variety of adherents. Since the KJB is more widely read in America today than in any other country, Campbell pays particular attention to the history of the KJB in the United States. Finally, the volume includes appendices that contain short biographies of the translators and a guide to the 74-page preliminaries of the 1611 edition. <br> <br>A fitting tribute to the enduring popularity of the King James Version, <em>Bible</em> offers an illuminating history of this most esteemed of biblical translations.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gordon Campbell</strong> is Professor of Renaissance Studies at Leicester University.

These methods provide clients and therapists new ways of both looking at problems and discovering solutions to these problems and are thus especially appropriate to skills training, role-development and expansion, relationship enhancement and short-term treatment with groups, couples and familes. Contributors provide a brief overview of featured action methods and illustrate the application of their particular method to specific therapy cases, discussing the rationale behind their clinical choices and how they handled any special challenges or complications. Chapters illustrate family therapy that focuses on dealing with grief and loss, family reorganization and the effects of trauma as well as group therapy approaches to the treatment of addictive and compulsive disorders, self-mutilation, substance abuse, autism, chronic mental illness and career difficulties.</p><p></p><h2>Living with Voices: 50 Stories of Recovery</h2><p><p>This book is a groundbreaking development in modern mental health because it recognises the importance of the first hand experience and argues that hearing voices is not a sign of madness but a reaction to serious problems in life. Must-read book for all concerned with mental health issues.</p></p><p>Marius Romme MD, PhD, was Professor of Social Psychiatry at the Medical Faculty of the University of Maastrict. He is now a Visiting Professor at the Centre for Community Mental Health, Birmingham City University. Together with Dr. Escher they focussed their research on the experience of hearing voices. This led to the Hearing Voices movement and to the estabishment of support groups for voice hearers world wide.The main result is that the voices which are heard have a function in the person&#39;s life and their characteristics are directly related to the person&#39;s emotional problems.This opens the recovery perspective for voice hearers.Sandra Escher, MPhil, PhD, was a science journalist and worked as a senior researcher at the University of Maastricht, focusing on children hearing voices.

In this timely, accessible and important book, they bring together the lessons they have learnt over more than two decades, and provide an opportunity for 50 voice hearers from across the world to tell us their stories. This is essential reading for mental health workers of all professions, which challenges conventional thinking, empowers mental health service users, and looks forward to a more humane approach to psychiatric care. Richard Bentall, Professor of Clinical Psychology, Bangor University, Wales ...rejects the traditional understanding of hearing voices as a symptom of major mental illness whose content is meaningless, and instead proposes that it is a response to trauma that has meaning and can be accepted and worked with to achieve recovery ... &#39;Living with Voices&#39; is an important book for all those interested in the hearing voices approach. It puts lived experience to the forefront, and demonstrates that it is possible to live with voices and win back control of one&#39;s life.

Written from the point of view of a woman in what we might now call mid-life crisis, <i>The Black Swan</i> evinces Mann's mastery of psychological analysis and his compelling interest in the intersection of the physical and the spiritual in human behavior. It is startlingly relevant to current discussions of the politics of the body, male inscriptions of the feminine, and discourse about and of women.

McKibben identifies two questions asked by Thoreau as central to a late-twentieth-century reading of Walden: "How much is enough?" and "How do I know what I want?" Questions, McKibben reminds us, that must come to dominate the end of the twentieth century if we are to live well into the twenty-first.<br><br>McKibben's relevant and lively introduction and annotations to the 1854 edition make us see Walden as, among other things, a way to think about how we use our time, how we spend our money --and how to live essential lives.</p><p>Founded in 1906 by J.M.

It blends straightforward theology with the account of this young couple s afflictions. A sober reality in the life of faith is that "through many tribulations we must enter the kingdom of God." God's people are buffeted in two ways: sometimes we suffer for the faith and other times we suffer with faith. Either way, our faith remains a work in progress. In the midst of troubles, our emotions can vacillate between hope and despair, submission and rebellion. Our understanding can alternate between moments of comprehension and times of total confusion. This book confronts these issues head-on and offers believers biblical perspective, practical direction, and sustaining hope.</p></p><p>Pastor Jim has over fifty years in Christian ministry: twenty-one as a teacher in Bible college and seminary and over thirty years as a pastor and Bible teacher. He brings a special wisdom-the kind that can only be learned through difficult times-to each message, whether through the written or spoken word. &#34;My brand, everyone would say, is teaching the Word of God,&#34; Jim says. &#34;Nothing brings me greater joy or fulfillment than to bring the Scriptures alive to God&#39;s people. As I see it, my job as a Bible teacher is to cause the issues of life and the truth of God&#39;s Word to collide violently at the intersections of the consciousness. God knows that brings me more satisfaction than anything on earth. Not far behind that is the opportunity to lead.&#34; Jim and his wife, Olsie, have the kind of relationship that most couples aspire to achieve. &#34;We have compatible tastes. We actually enjoy shopping together, and sitting and talking,&#34; Jim marvels. Yet the strength of their relationship has been tested time and again as they have walked through over twenty-eight years of suffering alongside their afflicted daughter, Juli, who, owing to an auto-immune disorder and brain injury, suffers from a mysterious and multi-layered debilitating condition. (This ordeal is described in detail in his book, Polishing God&#39;s Monuments: Pillars of Hope for Punishing Times.) Jim holds a B.A. degree in Journalism from West Virginia Institute of Technology, an M.A. in Classics from the University of Colorado (Boulder) and a Th.M. in New Testament from Dallas Theological Seminary. A native of West Virginia, he spent his first seven post- seminary years pastoring a small church in Poca, WV, before accepting an invitation to teach at Western Bible College (now a part of Colorado Christian University) from 1970-80 as director of pastoral studies. He then taught for eleven years at Western Seminary in Portland, OR, serving the last four years as chairman of the division of ministerial studies. Jim has served as the senior pastor of Lake Bible Church in Lake Oswego, OR, since 1990. He also hosts The Final Word, a popular radio program that airs daily in the greater Portland, OR, and Pittsburgh, PA, metro areas. Jim and Olsie have two married daughters, Kristi and Juli, and two married grandchildren (Ashley and Alex).<p>This book doesn't tiptoe around the topic of suffering, but hits head-on the hardest questions we have about the goodness of God and the problem of suffering.

Communities with disease clusters, women facing a growing breast cancer incidence rate, and people of color concerned about the asthma epidemic have become critical of biomedical models that emphasize the role of genetic makeup and individual lifestyle practices. Likewise, scientists have lost patience with their colleagues' and government's failure to adequately address environmental health issues and to safeguard research from corporate manipulation.<br><br>Focusing specifically on breast cancer, asthma, and Gulf War-related health conditions-"contested illnesses" that have generated intense debate in the medical and political communities-Phil Brown shows how these concerns have launched an environmental health movement that has revolutionized scientific thinking and policy. Before the last three decades of widespread activism regarding toxic exposures, people had little opportunity to get information. Few sympathetic professionals were available, the scientific knowledge base was weak, government agencies were largely unprepared, laypeople were not considered bearers of useful knowledge, and ordinary people lacked their own resources for discovery and action.<br><br>Brown argues that organized social movements are crucial in recognizing and acting to combat environmental diseases. His book draws on environmental and medical sociology, environmental justice, environmental health science, and social movement studies to show how citizen-science alliances have fought to overturn dominant epidemiological paradigms. His probing look at the ways scientific findings are made available to the public and the changing nature of policy offers a new perspective on health and the environment and the relationship among people, knowledge, power, and authority.</p><p><p>The power of social movements to revitalize and democratize scientific research.</p>Phil Brown is professor of sociology and environmental studies at Brown University. He has been writing about environmental health since the mid-1980s, beginning with <i>No Safe Place: Toxic Waste, Leukemia, and Community Action</i>, which focused on the Woburn childhood leukemia cluster. Since then he has studied many environmental groups and movements and has collaborated with environmental organizations on research. He is editor of <i>Perspectives in Medical Sociology</i> and co-editor of <i>Social Movements in Health</i> and <i>Illness and the Environment: A Reader in Contested Medicine</i>.<br> Phil Brown is a professor of Environmental Studies at Brown University.

But they were both fought in a world still dominated by Great Britain and the battle cry in both conflicts was freedom. Rajmohan Gandhi brings the drama of both wars to one stage in A Tale of Two Revolts.

This groundbreaking work suggests how it might at last prove possible to crack the allegorical code of medieval Islamic painting during its Golden Age between the fourteenth and seventeenth centuries. Barry focuses his study around the work of Bihz�d, a painter who flourished in the late fifteenth century in the kingdom of Herat, now in Afghanistan. Bihz�d became the undisputed master of the &#x201c;Persian miniature&#x201d; and an almost mythical personality throughout Asian Islam. By carefully deciphering the visual symbols in medieval Islamic figurative art, Barry&#x2019;s study deliberately takes a bold approach in order to decode the lost iconographic conventions of a civilization. The glorious illustrations, scholarly text, and extracts from Persian poetry, many translated into English for the first time, combine to create an essential new work of reference and a visual delight.</p><p>Michael Barry, born in New York City in 1948, raised in France, now lectures at Princeton University, his alma mater, on the traditional and modern cultures of Iran and especially Afghanistan. Barry is widely published and holds six literary prizes.<br>Stuart Cary Welch, former curator of Islamic and Later Indian Art at Harvard University&#x2019;s Fogg and Sackler Museums, is widely recognized as one of the world&#x2019;s foremost specialists of Persian and Mughal painting.The illuminated manuscripts of Kamaluddin Bihzad, a court painter to the early Safavid Dynasty, are revelations of color and form. His figures, rendered with fluid lines, are marvelously expressive, his backgrounds crowded with undulating trees or stunning architectural patterns. The eye is unsure where to alight, until it comes upon a central figure-a turbaned Joseph kneeling on a delicately patterned rug, or a horseman flinching as his mount transfigures into a seven-headed demon. Western scholars of Islamic art have been aware of Bihzad's gifts for some time, but most have dismissively categorized his work as illustrative. However, Barry contends Bihzad's paintings are of an intensely religious quality, despite the Islamic injunction against images. Barry's arguments are convincing, his erudition is impressive, and his book is stuffed with delightful reproductions. But his prose can be repetitive, and his organizational choices can confuse the reader. Why, for example, does Barry discuss the history of "Orientalist" scholarship and Bihzad's influence on Matisse before reporting Bihzad was born around "1465, died in 1535, and was a native of the Central Asian kingdom of Herat, an oasis in what is now northwestern Afghanistan"? In all, the book is a detailed introduction to an unsung genius, but it may be too detailed and circuitous for the casual reader.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

In Vital Nourishment, Fran�ois Jullien contends that although this process has given rise to a rich history of inquiry, it proceeds too fast. In their anxiety about meaning, Western thinkers since Plato have forgotten simply to experience life. In this installment of his continuing project of plumbing the philosophical divide between Eastern and Western thought, Jullien slows down, and, using the third and fourth century B.C.E. Chinese thinker Zhuanghi as a foil, begins to think about life from a point outside of Western inquiry.The question of how to &#x201c;feed life,&#x201d; or nourish it, is the point of departure for the Chinese tradition that Jullien locates in Zhuanghi. Life passes through each of us, and we have a duty to become amenable to its ebbs and flows. We must cultivate a sense of being adequate to it so that we can house it. Exploring notions of breath, energy, and immanence, Jullien reopens a vibrant space of intellectual exchange between East and West. In doing so, he refuses to commit to a rigid framework of meaning, and his text unfolds as an elegant process that mirrors the very type of thought he explores. Pointing out that it seems intellectually and politically imperative today to reinvigorate Western thought with ideas from the East, Jullien seeks to create a space of mutual inquiry that maintains the integrity of both Eastern and Western thinking. Vital Nourishment is both a rich intellectual historical journey and a text very much attuned to the philosophical politics of the present.</p></p><p>Fran�ois Jullien is Professor at the Universit� Paris VII-Denis Diderot and director at the Institut de la Pens�e Contemporaine. He is the author of <i>Detour and Access: Strategies of Meaning in China and Greece, The Propensity of Things: Toward a History of Efficacy in China,</i> and <i>In Praise of Blandness: Proceeding from Chinese Thought and Aesthetics</i> all published by Zone Books.</p><h2>Apollonius of Rhodes: Argonautica Book III (Cambridge Greek and Latin Classics)</h2><p>Composed in the third century B.C., the Argonautica is the only extant Greek epic between Homer and the later Roman Empire. It tells of Jason&#39;s successful expedition with the Argonauts to recover the Golden Fleece from Colchis on the Black Sea. Medea, a young Colchian princess, falls in love with Jason and helps him survive the ordeals imposed by her father. The description of Medea&#39;s emotional suffering exercised a profound influence on subsequent writers and especially on Virgil in his account of Dido and Aeneas. Dr. Hunter&#39;s edition provides a comprehensive introduction to the poem and its poet, an up-to-date text of Book III and a full commentary that discusses the problems of language and translation. He also delves into the poetic meaning of the work and Apollonius&#39; creative use of the Homeric heritage.</p><p>Text: English, Greek</p><h2>The Misfits: Story of a shoot</h2><p>Tells the story of the making of the legendary film &#34;The Misfits&#34; (1961), directed by John Huston and starring Marilyn Monroe, Clark Gable and Montgomery Clift. As part of the promotional strategy for the film, The Magnum photographic agency was given the exclusive right to take photographs during the shooting. Eight of its most famous photographers covered the production, both on and off the set. Two hundred of their pictures are reproduced here in rich duotone, providing both a documentary of the making of a film and an intimate portrait of three of the most famous film stars of all time. The photographs are accompanied by an essay recounting the tragic and triumphant story of the film and an interview with Arthur Miller, husband of Marilyn Monroe and writer of the movie.</p><p>Arthur Miller was America&#39;s leading dramatist over the last 50 years. His plays include Death of a Salesman (1940), The Crucible (1953) and A View From the Bridge (1955). He is also the author of the novel, Focus (1945), and several non-fiction works. Miller adapted the screenplay for The Misfits from his own story. Serge Toubiana is Editor-in-Chief of the influential film magazine Cahiers du cinema. He is also the co-author of several books about the cinema, including the biography Truffaut (1999).The last film made by Clark Gable and Marilyn Monroe, one of the last made by Montgomery Clift, and the only one scripted by playwright Miller, then at the peak of his career, <i>The Misfits</i> (1961) was a prestige picture, whose entourage included a team of stellar photographers from the photojournalist agency Magnum. The lensers' work furnishes the enthralling core of this book, but the contributions of Miller and Toubiana, editor of the French film journal <i>Cahiers du Cinema</i>, aren't negligible. Interviewed by Toubiana, Miller says the film was intended as a vehicle for Monroe to establish her credentials as a dramatic actress, and he expresses disappointment that director John Huston allowed so few long shots, for Miller felt that showing the characters in the vacant western landscape of its setting would be a powerful visual metaphor of their social isolation. Toubiana's discussion of the production valuably augments Miller's perspective and critiques previous written accounts. Even without so many splendid photographs of such photogenic people, this would be a fascinating film book. <i>Ray Olson</i><br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

In this biography, Jeff Broadwater focuses on Madison's role in the battle for religious freedom in Virginia, his contributions to the adoption of the Constitution and the Bill of Rights, his place in the evolution of the party system, his relationship with Dolley Madison, his performance as a wartime commander in chief, and his views on slavery. From Broadwater's perspective, no single figure can tell us more about the origins of the American republic than our fourth president.<br>In these pages, Madison emerges as a remarkably resilient politician, an unlikely wartime leader who survived repeated setbacks in the War of 1812 with his popularity intact. Yet Broadwater shows that despite his keen intelligence, the more Madison thought about one issue, race, the more muddled his thinking became, and his conviction that white prejudices were intractable prevented him from fully grappling with the dilemma of American slavery.<br><br></p><p>"Broadwater has mastered the voluminous literature on Madison.

As Joel Dinerstein reveals in this&nbsp;dynamic book, cool began as a stylish defiance of racism, a challenge to suppressed sexuality, a philosophy of individual rebellion, and a youthful search for social change.<br><br> Through eye-opening&nbsp;portraits of iconic figures,&nbsp;Dinerstein illuminates the cultural connections and artistic innovations among Lester Young, Humphrey Bogart, Robert Mitchum, Billie Holiday, Frank Sinatra, Jack Kerouac, Albert Camus, Marlon Brando, and James Dean, among others. We eavesdrop on conversations among Jean-Paul Sartre, Simone de Beauvoir, and Miles Davis, and on a forgotten debate between&nbsp;Lorraine Hansberry and Norman Mailer over the "white Negro" and black cool. We come to&nbsp;understand how the cool worlds of Beat writers and Method actors emerged from the intersections of film noir, jazz, and existentialism.&nbsp;Out of this mix, Dinerstein sketches nuanced definitions of cool that unite concepts from African-American and Euro-American culture: the stylish stoicism of the ethical rebel loner; the relaxed intensity of the improvising jazz musician; the effortless, physical grace of the Method actor. To be cool is not to be hip and to be hot is definitely not to be cool.<br><br> This is the first work to trace the history of cool during the Cold War by exploring the intersections of film noir, jazz, existential literature, Method acting, blues, and rock and roll.&nbsp;Dinerstein reveals that they came together to create something completely new&#x2014;and that something is cool<i>.</i></p><p><b>Joel Dinerstein</b> was the curator of American Cool, an acclaimed exhibit at the Smithsonian&#x2019;s National Portrait Gallery, and the author of its accompanying catalog. He is also the author of the award-winning <i>Swinging the Machine: Modernity, Technology, and African-American Culture</i> and <i>Coach: A History of New York Cool</i>. He is a cultural historian and professor of English at Tulane University.&#x201c;In his entertaining book, . . . Dinerstein shows that cool isn&#x2019;t just a style, it&#x2019;s an &#x2018;embodied philosophy&#x2019; that is anchored in a specific generational circumstance. Cool was first of all a form of resistance and rebellion, a rejection of the innocence, optimism and consumer cheeriness that marked the mainstream postwar experience.&#x201d; (David Brooks <i>New York Times</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;These divisions, between white and black, Europe and America, individual and society, run through the history of cool and explain the different forms it takes and how these have evolved. . . . The history of post-war cool is both a history of these strange convergence&#x2014;between French intellectuals, African American musicians and white working-class Hollywood heroes&#x2014;and of the continuing conflicts between and within them. The real subject of Dinerstein&#x2019;s book is the debt that American culture owes to black art and style, and the way white America has responded to that debt.&#x201d; (Benjamin Markovits <i>Times Literary Supplement</i> 2017-07-18)<br><br>&#x201c;Dinerstein beautifully demonstrates in this superb book . . . that cool was &#x2018;an emergent structure of feeling in postwar America.&#x2019; . . . What made cool cool is the braiding together of jazz, film noir, and existential literature; the first as an African American mask of cool (poise, virtuosity and &#x2018;a blank facial wall, suggesting both a resistance to white social norms and an inner complexity&#x2019;); the second, a delayed working-class response to the Great Depression (gritty but righteous loners in an unjust world); the third, an ethical expression of &#x2018;rebellion-for-others&#x2019; in 1945, &#x2018;year zero&#x2019; Europe after collaboration, genocide and atomic destruction.&#x201d; (<i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Rigorously academic, <i>The Origins of Cool</i> is nonetheless the kind of book that makes learning enjoyable. Afterward, you&#x2019;ll know a lot more about the world today and where it came from. But if you&#x2019;re cool, you&#x2019;ll pretend you don&#x2019;t.&#x201d; (<i>Wall Street Journal</i> 2017-06-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Dinerstein traces the trajectory of the notion of American cool through the cultural milieu of the 1920s through the early 1960s, emphasizing its deep associations with jazz culture. . . . Impressively researched and broad in its reach, drawing from film, music, theater, philosophy, and literature, this book approaches the subject with scholarly authority while remaining eminently readable. Much more than just a history of cool, this book is a studied examination of the very real, often problematic social issues that popular culture responds to.&#x201d; (<i>Publishers Weekly, starred review</i>)<br><br><i>&#x201c;The Origins of Cool</i>&nbsp;vibrates with the energy of its very subject&#x2014;as&nbsp;restrained, composed, and revitalized&nbsp;as the postwar rebel himself.&nbsp;&nbsp;From the cafes of the existentialists to the bars of film noir, from Lester Young&#x2019;s sax to Elvis&#x2019;s pout, Dinerstein offers a brilliant exegesis of the simmering mode of resistance we call cool. He penetrates the meanings of a misunderstood mode&#x2014;a concept, a mood, a posture&#x2014;while connecting the rich details of art and culture to the deepest transformations of the postwar world.&nbsp;<i>The Origins of Cool&nbsp;</i>takes the&nbsp;elusive and inchoate and&nbsp;renders them clear and nearly tangible, making the reader feel this mysterious current of postwar culture as if for the first time. This is a masterwork.&#x201d; (Jefferson Cowie, author of Stayin&#x2019; Alive: The 1970s and the Last Days of the Working Class)<br><br>&#x201c;Dinerstein maps out a grand unified theory of 'cool,' as the concept that came to define the postwar era.&#x201d; (<i>New York Times Book Review</i> 2017-06-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Dinerstein approaches the notion of coolness as a theorist, historian and lover of popular culture to produce a book that synthesizes the best of all three domains. Our interpretation of cool may be emptying out, may be changing with each new generation&#x2019;s cultural output, but a close examination of the roots of coolness shows that as a fundamental way of being in the world, little about cool has changed.&#x201d; (<i>PopMatters</i> 2017-06-01)<br><br>&#x201c;Dinerstein has written a thoughtful and entertaining account of cool&#x2014;the most powerful image of how one should be since the English gentleman dominated the world. It's a history, a handbook, and a manual, filled with fascinating accounts of those stellar individuals whose aggressively haughty, patrician coldness was rooted in hip opposition and revolt.&#x201d; (John Szwed, author of Billie Holiday: The Musician and the Myth)<br><br><i>&#x201c;The Origins of Cool in Postwar America </i>will be the standard reference for those who wish to understand the deep historical roots for coolness as a cultural style and ethos&#x2014;a &#x2018;public mode of covert resistance,&#x2019; an expression of faith in the integrity and agency of the individual in the face of depression, war, occupation, segregation, and the threat of nuclear annihilation&#x2014;rather than as a trendy pose or an emblem of hip consumerism.&nbsp;Dinerstein has achieved something like a&nbsp;unified field theory of the postwar American arts combined with a history of ideas attached to the quest for ethical renewal and existential affirmation.&#x201d; (John Gennari, author of Blowin' Hot and Cool: Jazz and Its Critics)</p><h2>The Mind Has Mountains: Reflections on Society and Psychiatry</h2><p><p>From strenuous opposition to physician-assisted suicide to a conviction that sex-correction surgery for newborns is cruel and misguided, Dr. Paul R.

A religious woman, she fasted and prayed for help. As she studied a set of women's advice booklets from the 1920s, Andelin had an epiphany that not only changed her life but also affected the lives of millions of American women. She applied the principles from the booklets and found that her disinterested husband became loving and attentive. He bought her gifts and hurried home from work to be with her. Andelin took her new-found happiness as a sign that it was her religious duty to share these principles with other women. She began leading small discussion groups for women at her church. The results were dramatic. In 1963, at the urging of her followers, Andelin wrote and self-published Fascinating Womanhood. The book, which borrowed heavily from those 1920s advice booklets, the Bible, and classical literature, eventually sold over three million copies and launched a nationwide organization of classes and seminars led by thousands of volunteer teachers.<br><br>Countering second-wave feminists in the 1960s, Andelin preached family values and urged women not to have careers, but to become good wives, mothers, and homemakers instead. A woman's true happiness, taught Andelin, could only be realized if she admired, cared for, and obeyed her husband. As Andelin's notoriety grew, so did the backlash from her critics. Undeterred, she became a national celebrity, who was interviewed extensively and appeared in sold-out speaking engagements.<br><br>Andelin's message calling for the return to traditional roles appealed to many in a time of uncertainty and radical social change. This study provides an evenhanded and important look at a crucial, but often overlooked cross section of American women as they navigated their way through the turbulent decades following the post-war calm of the 1950s.</p><p><b>Julie Neuffer</b> earned her master&#x2019;s degree in religious studies from Gonzaga University and her Ph.D. in American history from Washington State University.

From being viewed as an activity performed in practical and political contexts, it came to be conceived in terms of theoria, or the wise man as a &#39;spectator&#39; of truth.

All of his Hebrew professors in college and graduate school were involved in the translation of the New International Version of the Bible. In their classes, he learned of the inner workings involved in the translation process. In graduate school, he and another student studied advanced Hebrew under Dr. Earl S. Kalland, who was on the executive committee for the translation work of the New International. It was this committee that made the final decisions on the particular renderings used in the original NIV translation.<br> Having done his undergraduate work in Jewish Studies, Chaim was interested in the role of Jewish literature in biblical translation. Professor Kalland encouraged him to seek out an orthodox rabbi and discuss the translation process from a Jewish perspective. From this experience, he discovered many things about the Hebrew language that he had not learned in his years of Hebrew studies in a Christian environment. Later, from his contact with Jewish rabbis and his studies in the Talmud, the Mishnah, and other works of Jewish literature, as well as his studies in the Semitic languages, Chaim began doing Hebrew word studies as devotionals and sending them out by e-mail to former students whom he had taught in his thirteen years as an instructor in Hebrew and Old Testament at World Harvest Bible College, as well as those he taught through Chaim Bentorah Ministries.<br> After self-publishing several books of Hebrew word studies and related topics, Chaim chose ninety word studies to create <i>Hebrew Word Study: Revealing the Heart of God</i>, which is his first book with Whitaker House. He believes that if we take the time to study the Hebrew language, we can see the true beauty of God&#x2019;s Word and come to know God and His heart in a much deeper way.You are going to love reading<i> Hebrew Word Study: Revealing the Heart of God! </i>For decades, I've had the privilege of learning from the wit and wisdom of Chaim Bentorah.

Instructors praise Sniffy, a realistic digital rat in an operant chamber (Skinner Box), for his ability to give students hands-on experience in setting up and conducting experiments that demonstrate the phenomena of classical and operant conditioning. Users begin by training Sniffy to press a bar to obtain food. Then they progress to studies of more complex learning phenomena. Throughout each, a series of &#34;Mind Windows&#34; enables students to visualize how Sniffy&#39;s experiences in the chamber produce the psychological changes that their textbooks discuss in connection with learning. Available on a cross-platform CD-ROM, the Lite version of Sniffy includes twenty-three exercises that cover the essential phenomena of learning psychology, making it equally appropriate for psychology of learning and introductory psychology courses. The CD-ROM comes with a Lab Manual that walks users through the steps necessary to set up classical and operant conditioning experiments that closely resemble the experiments discussed in learning texts. (Screen shots are included for both Macintosh and Windows users.) The manual also includes instructions on how to print or e-mail results so that Sniffy can become part of students&#39; homework assignments and term papers.</p><p>Tom Alloway was trained by Winifred Hill at Northwestern University and is an expert in animal behavior, specifically ants, as well as operant and classical conditioning.

This book is a description and analysis of the Chinese form of Buddhism called Hua-yen (or Hwa-yea), Flower Ornament, based largely on one of the more systematic treatises of its third patriarch. Hua-yen Buddhism strongly resembles Whitehead's process philosophy, and has strong implications for modern philosophy and religion. Hua-yen Buddhism explores the philosophical system of Hua-yen in greater detail than does Garma C.C. Chang's <em>The Buddhist Teaching of Totality </em>(Penn State, 1971). An additional value is the development of the questions of ethics and history. Thus, Professor Cook presents a valuable sequel to Professor Chang's pioneering work. The Flower Ornament School was developed in China in the late 7th and early 8th centuries as an innovative interpretation of Indian Buddhist doctrines in the light of indigenous Chinese presuppositions, chiefly Taoist. Hua-yen is a cosmic ecology, which views all existence as an organic unity, so it has an obvious appeal to the modern individual, both students and layman.</p></p><p></p><h2>Random Data: Analysis &amp; Measurement Procedures</h2><p>The classic reference on the theory and application of random data analysis-now expanded and revised.

During his brief life (1933-1988), he went against the grain of art world trends, humanizing the institutional spaces of art with the force of his humor, spirituality, and character. Twenty years after Thek's death from AIDS, we can now recognize his influence on contemporary artists ranging from Vito Acconci and Bruce Nauman to Matthew Barney, Mike Kelley, and Paul McCarthy, as well as Kai Althoff, Jonathan Meese, and Thomas Hirschhorn. This book brings together more than 300 of Thek's works--many of which are published here for the first time--to offer the most comprehensive display of his work yet seen. The book, which accompanies an exhibition at ZKM ? Museum of Contemporary Art presenting Thek's work in dialogue with contemporary art by young artists, includes painting, sculpture, drawing, and installation work, as well as photographs documenting the room-size environments into which Thek incorporated elements from art, literature, theater, and religion. These works chart Thek's journey from legendary outsider to foundational figure in contemporary art. In their antiheroic diversity, Thek's works embody the art revolution of the 1960s; indeed, Susan Sontag dedicated her classic Against Interpretation to him. Thek's treatment of the body in such works as "Technological Reliquaries," with their castings and replicas of human body parts, tissue, and bones, both evoke the aura of Christian relics and anticipate the work of Damien Hirst. The book, with more than 500 images (300 in color) and nineteen essays by art historians, curators, collectors, and artists, investigates Thek's work on its own terms, and as a starting point for understanding the work of the many younger artists Thek has influenced.Essays byJean-Christophe Ammann, Margrit Brehm, Bazon Brock, Suzanne Delehanty, Harald Falckenberg, Marietta Franke, Stefan Germer, Kim Gordon, Roland Groenenboom, Axel Heil, Gregor Jansen, Mike Kelley, John Miller, Susanne Neubauer, Kenny Schachter, Harald Szeemann, Annette Tietenberg, Peter Weibel, Ann Wilson</p></p><p>Harald Falckenberg is President of the Kunstrverein Hamburg and cocurator of ZKM's Paul Thek exhibit.

In The Epic History of Biology, Anthony Serafini - a distinguished philosopher and historian of science - regales the reader with the triumphs and failures of the geniuses of the life sciences. The subtleties of the animal kingdom - anatomy, zoology, and reproduction - along with the complexities of the plant kingdom, have fascinated humanity as far back as 5000 years ago. Astounding ancient knowledge of the arcane curing powers of herbs as well as early experimentation with different chemical combinations for such purposes as mummification led to today&#39;s biological technology. Innovative pioneers such as Aristotle, Galen, Hippocrates, and Vesalius challenged the limits of knowledge and single-mindedly pursued their work, often in the face of blind superstition. In superb, lyrical prose Serafini recreates the ideas and theories of these revolutionaries from ancient times through today, against the backdrop of the dogma and prejudices of their time. He explores the inspired revelations that gave birth to such discoveries as the controversial theory of evolution, the humble origins of genetics, the fantastic predictions of quantum mechanics, and the infinite promise of computer technology. Even today the biological sciences are undergoing rapid and kaleidoscopic changes. Every new insight gives rise to a myriad of new ethical questions and responsibilities. The Epic History of Biology confronts these issues head on and predicts the wondrous new directions biology will follow.</p><p>Anthony Serafini has been a Visiting Fellow in Philosophy at Princeton University and has taught journalism at the University of Massachusetts. He is currently Associate Professor of Philosophy at Centenary College, Hackettstown, New Jersey.</p><h2>Biblical Hebrew for Students of Modern Israeli Hebrew</h2><p>This is the first textbook written for the purpose of teaching biblical Hebrew to college-level students who already know some modern, Israeli Hebrew. Marc Brettler provides a clear, comprehensive book with numerous well-constructed exercises to help students either make the transition from modern Israeli Hebrew to biblical Hebrew or deepen their understanding of biblical Hebrew. The book is also ideal for individuals who might like to study independently, and for serious Jewish adult-education programs.<br><br><i>Biblical Hebrew for Students of Modern Israeli Hebrew</i> is unique in its emphasis on phonology, based on the conviction that a strong grounding in phonology makes it possible to learn biblical Hebrew grammar in a much more systematic fashion. This method also allows verbal conjugations to be taught much more quickly and systematically. Although the text is not inductive, it uses authentic biblical texts throughout to illustrate fundamental points, and it contains many biblical texts in the exercises. Students progressing through the book will quickly be encouraged by a sense of accomplishment as they encounter and understand well-known biblical passages. <br></p><p><b>Marc Zvi Brettler</b> is professor of Hebrew Bible in the Department of Near Eastern and Judaic Studies at Brandeis University and serves as chair of the department. <br>"Brettler has given us a comprehensive textbook that will serve the broadest needs of various teaching styles." -- <i>William Schniedewind, UCLA</i><br><br>"Not only would I use this book in the classroom, I will recommend it to students as a helpful reference." -- <i>Ehud Ben Avi, University of Alberta</i><br><br>"This book provides an important service to students and teachers alike." -- <i>Christine Hayes, Yale University</i><br><br>. . . .

Jerome Kagan, a theorist and leading researcher, examines popular practices and assumptions held by many psychologists. He uncovers a variety of problems that, troublingly, are largely ignored by investigators and clinicians. Yet solutions are available, Kagan maintains, and his reasoned suggestions point the way to a better understanding of the mind and mental illness.</p><p>Kagan identifies four problems in contemporary psychology: the indifference to the setting in which observations are gathered, including the age, class, and cultural background of participants and the procedure that provides the evidence (he questions, for example, the assumption that similar verbal reports of well-being reflect similar psychological states); the habit of basing inferences on single measures rather than patterns of measures (even though every action, reply, or biological response can result from more than one set of conditions); the defining of mental illnesses by symptoms independent of their origin; and the treatment of mental disorders with drugs and forms of psychotherapy that are nonspecific to the diagnosed illness. The author's candid discussion will inspire the debate that is needed in a discipline seeking to fulfill its promises.</p></p><p><p><b>Jerome Kagan</b> is Professor of Psychology Emeritus, Harvard University, where he was co-director of the Mind/Brain Behavior Interfaculty Initiative.

For the latter, including persons suffering from some form of mental illness, the book represents a reliable and user friendly source of information about the present status of psychological and psychiatric research and clinical practice.

For a public enamored of looking inward to genes, brain circuits and medications to find solutions to the problems that plague us privately and politically, the message that most of those solutions require us to look outward&#x2014;to culture, class and context&#x2014;can't be repeated often enough.&#x201d;&#x2014;Carol Tavris, <i>Wall Street Journal</i> (Carol Tavris <i>Wall Street Journal</i>)<br><br>"Kagan is thorough and precise in this remarkable book. He has a chapter of positive recommendations, but as he notes, he&#x2019;s not the first to point out these limitations, which have so far mostly been ignored. What he&#x2019;s basically calling for is some humility, and acknowledgement of complexity, differences and connections."&#x2014;Bill Kowinski, <i>North Cost Journal</i> (Bill Kowinski <i>North Coast Journal</i>)<br><br>"If anyone has the stature and wisdom to shake a finger at contemporary psychology and say "shame on you," it is Kagan . . .

He considers "the biology of folklore" and emphasizes the dynamic, everyday, everywhere richness of folk expressions from occupational and ethnic lore to foodways, holidays, personal experience narratives, legends, ballads, myths, provers, jokes, crafts, and others, clearly tracing the cultural worldviews folklore conveys and how it expresses them. Throughout the text Toelken offers students and others practical instruction and advice on methods and study, including field research, cross-cultural understanding, discerning the context and meaning of folk performances, and recording and archiving folklore. Extensive bibliographical essays outline the history and literature of folklore, and over one hundred photographs illustrate examples of folk events, arts, and processes. The Dynamics Of Folklore is a benchmark body of scholarship and essential reading for any serious folklorist. -- <i>Midwest Book Review</i></p><h2>Justice, Justice (History of Schools and Schooling)</h2><p>In 1968, a bitter struggle broke out between white New York City teacher unionists and black community organizers over efforts to create community control of the city's schools. The New York conflict reverberated across the United States, calling into question the possibility of creating equitable schools and cementing racial antagonism at the center of American politics. A path-breaking study of teacher organizing, civil rights movement activism, and urban education, <i>Justice, Justice: School Politics and the Eclipse of Liberalism</i> recounts how teachers' and activists' ideals shaped the school crisis and placed them at the epicenter of America's racial conflict. Taking into account much of twentieth-century American history to uncover the roots of the school conflict, this book illuminates the dilemmas and hopes that continue to shape urban schools.</p><p><strong>Daniel H. Perlstein</strong> is a historian at the Graduate School of Education, University of California, Berkeley. After working as a high school teacher and teachers union activist in New York City, he attended Stanford University, where he received his Ph.D. in history and education. He is the author of numerous scholarly works examining the interplay of social inequalities and democratic aspirations in the history of American educational politics and practices."Daniel Perlstein's gripping interdisciplinary examination of the New York school wars of the 1960s teaches us much about the complex and shifting interactions of politics, ideology, race, social class, and unionism when social change is attempted. This is the way educational history should be done. Perlstein must now be viewed as one of the eminent social theorists of our time." William Watkins, author, �The White Architects of Black Education: Ideology and Power in America, 1865-1954�<br><br>"Like a ghost, the 1968 New York teachers strike continues to haunt America's fractured political and educational landscape. Daniel Perlstein's long-awaited account of the strike demonstrates the enormous range of meanings that black and white Americans affixed to terms such as 'community', 'freedom', and 'equality'. Even better, Perstein shows how our present-day dilemmas over race and education reflect the very same controversies that the strike unleashed. Eminently fair and respectful to every side of the dispute, this wise book will force its readers to grapple anew with the ghost of 1968. If the history that Perlstein presents is often frightful, the costs of ignoring it are even scarier. Jonathan Zimmerman, author, �Whose America?

They reflect the author&#x2019;s belief that the Holocaust transcends traditional patterns of historical understanding and requires an epistemologically distinct approach. One can no longer assume that actors as well as historians are operating in the same conceptual universe, sharing the same criteria of rational discourse. This is particularly true of victims and perpetrators, whose memories shape the distortions of historical narrative in ways often diametrically opposed.<br><br>The essays are divided into three groups. The first group talks about anti-Semitism in the context of the 1930s and the ideologies that drove the Nazi regime. The second group concentrates on the almost unbelievably different perceptions of the "Final Solution," with particularly illuminating discussions of the Judenrat, or Jewish council. The third group considers the Holocaust as the subject of narrative and historical memory. Diner focuses above all on perspectives: the very notions of rationality and irrationality are seen to be changeable, depending on who is applying them. And because neither rational nor irrational motives can be universally assigned to participants in the Holocaust, Diner proposes, from the perspective of the victims, the idea of the counterrational. His work is directed toward developing a theory of Holocaust historiography and offers, clearly and coherently, the highest level of reflection on these problems.<br><br></p><p>&#x201c;The brilliance of Diner&#x2019;s essays stems in good part from the astonishingly wide perspectives in which he sets his inquiries and from the interdisciplinary synthesis he is able to master. Publication in English is of extreme importance in enriching the debates on Nazism and the Holocaust in this country.&#x201d;&#x2015;Saul Friedlander, author of <i>Nazi Germany and the Jews</i><br><br>"One of the most probing and intellectually sophisticated historians of the German Jewish conundrum, Dan Diner has a quality of mind and an intellectual depth and precision that are altogether unique.&#x201d;&#x2015;Anson Rabinbach, author of <i>In the Shadow of Catastrophe</i><b>Dan Diner</b> is Professor at the Ben-Gurion University of the Negev, Beer-Sheva, and Director of the Simon Dubnow Institute for Jewish History and Culture at Leipzig University.</p><h2>BSD UNIX Toolbox: 1000+ Commands for FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD</h2><p>Learn how to use BSD UNIX systems from the command line with BSD UNIX Toolbox: 1000+ Commands for FreeBSD, OpenBSD and NetBSD.

The practice of surveying is changing rapidly because of the availability of electronically controlled instruments, automatic capture and rapid transfer of field measurements, widespread adoption of the Global Positioning system GPS , and the proliferation of various geographic Land Information Systems GIS/LIS . Nevertheless, the principles underlying the new technology remain fairly constant. For example, the basic equations and computing techniques presented in this book are used to develop the computer programs employed by the practicing surveyor. Software is available for practically any situation encountered by the surveyor, including coordinate geometry, traverse calculations, adjustment computations, directions from astronomical observations, road design and layout, earthwork calculations, and stake-out data. The authors have attempted to present the material underlying these forgoing advances in such a way that the student can learn the principles of surveying by self-study. References at the ends of the chapters are intended to expand the knowledge acquired throughout study of the basic principles found in the book. Several major revisions have been made since the previous edition. Moreover, every chapter has been brought up to date and changed , although some only slightly. The information on Inertial Surveying has been dropped completely. Chapter 10 is devoted to GPS, thus separating traditional control surveying from this expanding technology and providing a simple but comprehensive explanation of GPS. Emphasis is placed on the NAD 83 as contrasted with NAD 27, as the redefinitions of the control networks in North America are now complete and the new datum is being utilized at a rapidly growing rate. In Chapter 11 we provide a computer program TRANSFOR to compute state plane coordinates. The examples provided with the program are the same as those given in the text. Chapter 20 on Geographic Information Systems has been added, along with a problem set and a compete and an extensive bibliography. Appendix A has been shortened considerably be removing the sections no the adjustment of triangulation. We have worked hard to make this book readable and easy to understand, while at the same time presenting current material that will be valuable to the modern surveyor.

Studies of process mechanisms and rates have become sufficiently numerous to allow a systematic study of slopes. Only by making a synthesis of quantitative process studies and relating them to the development of slope forms can the shape of the landscape be understood and the separate effects of lithology and climate assessed. In the introductory part of this book, the choice of appropriate system and scale is discussed, and models for uplift and erosion evaluated. Attention is thus focused on the dynamic equilibrium of the slope profile and its erosional development over time. Part I then examines the forces encouraging hillslope movement and the resistances opposing movement. Part 2 considers processes of rock instability, soil instability, wash, solution and soil creep. Each is discussed in terms of its mechanism and rate of operation, and the slope provides it produces. Part 3 outlines how this systematic approach may be applied to areas of different climate and the extent to which there is an assemblage of processes characteristic of each area. In part 4, the process evidence and models are combined into theoretical sequences of slope profile development, and the effect of contour curvature in modifying these profiles on spurts and in hollows is examined.</p><p>Hillslopes occupy most the landscape.

They throw critical light on the roots of neo-liberal globalization today.&#39; - James Tully, University of Victoria, Canada &#39;A brilliant, lucid and supremely relevant survey of the true origins of the state which cuts through the imprecision of much more theory and offers ideas which are of direct relevance not just to academics but to those engaged in the political process. A reminder that academic analysis need not be dull and irrelevant. A text, drawn from live speech, which captures the magic of a brilliant mind at work.&#39; - Nick Butler, Cambridge Centre for Energy Studies, UK Praise for the series: &#39;These lectures offer important insights into the evolution of the primary focus of Foucault&#39;s later work - the relationship between power and knowledge.&#39; - Library Journal &#39;Ideas spark off nearly every page...The words may have been spoken in [the 1970s] but they seem as alive and relevant as if they had been written yesterday.&#39; - Bookforum &#39;Foucault is quite central to our sense of where we are...&#39; - The Nation &#39;[Foucault] has an alert and sensitive mind that can ignore the familiar surfaces of established intellectual codes and ask new questions...[He] gives dramatic quality to the movement of culture.&#39; - The New York Review of Books</p><h2>The Professional Practice of Architectural Working Drawings</h2><p><b>The practical, comprehensive handbook to creating effective architectural drawings</b> <p>In one beautifully illustrated volume, <i>The Professional Practice of Architectural Working Drawings</i> presents the full range of skills, concepts, principles, and applications needed to create a full set of architectural working drawings.

Here is a narrative account of decisive engagements that succeeded by brilliant strategy more than by direct force. The reader accompanies those who fought, from Roman legionaries and Mongol horsemen to Napoleonic soldiery, American Civil War Rebels and Yankees, World War I Tommies, Lawrence of Arabia's bedouins, Chinese revolutionaries, British Desert Rats, Rommel's Afrika Korps, and Douglas MacArthur's Inchon invaders. However varied their weapons, the soldiers of all these eras followed a commander who faced the same obstacles and demonstrated the strategic and tactical genius essential for victory. "All warfare is based on deception," wrote Sun Tzu in <em>The Art of War</em> in 400 BCE. Bevin Alexander shows how great generals have interpreted this advice, and why it still holds true today.</p> Maps, illustrations</p><p>Bevin Alexander is the author of How Great Generals Win, Lost Victories, and Inside the Nazi War Machine. He lives in Bremo Bluff, Virginia.An astute military historian's mildly contrarian appraisal of what separates the sheep from the wolves in the great game of war. Arguing that von Clausewitz's thoughts about the bloody solution of battle have been misread over the years, Alexander (Lost Victories, 1992, etc.) asserts that the principal purpose of armed conflict is to reduce the possibility of an enemy's resistance (a view the author shares with Sun Tzu). Alexander then ranges back and forth through time to identify and comment upon commanders who were able, in the words of Stonewall Jackson, to ``mystify, mislead, and surprise'' their foes. Among those who measure up are Scipio Africanus (who bested Hannibal); Napoleon (who, in 1797, conquered northern Italy through innovative techniques); Sherman (whose march to the sea broke the South's will during the Civil War); Subedai (whose Mongol hordes sacked Buda and Pest during the mid-13th century), and MacArthur (whose daring Inchon assault turned the tide of the Korean War). Covered as well are the bold WW I campaigns mounted by Allenby and Lawrence in the Middle East; Mao's defeat of the Kuomintang; and the nervy genius of three top generals whose misfortune it was to serve Nazi Germany--Guderian, Rommel, and von Manstein. A merciless critic of annihilative, brute-force engagements (of the sort he witnessed as a US Army officer in Korea), Alexander makes a persuasive case for great captains who achieve their strategic ends via maneuver, stealth, guile, or a willingness to defy conventional wisdom. The author's analysis suggests that the doctrines that guide professional soldiers (be they Roman legionnaires or Norman Schwarzkopfs) have remained notably constant for more than two millennia. Informed opinions on the martial arts that draw provocative distinctions between victors and winners. (Maps--not seen) -- <i>Copyright �1993, Kirkus Associates, LP.

But Lisa Harper makes digging into Hebrews fun and doable, as only she can, without losing an ounce of depth. Hebrews was a sermon for a specific people and culture in the midst of martyrdom and persecution, but is also so relevant for us today, reminding us to continue walking toward Jesus regardless of our culture or our circumstances. Join Lisa as she journeys through this bridge between the Old and New Testaments to get to the heart of the matter: Jesus is our accessible King. He is not a faraway God, but an up-close Redeemer who draws near to us.

The book is marked by the impressive ecumenism that readers expect from SkyLight Paths publications: subjects include Catholic Worker founder Dorothy Day, Orthodox rabbi Abraham Isaac Kook, Hare Krishna founder Bhaktivedanta Prabuphada, pagan author Starhawk and evangelist Billy Graham. Many of the entries vividly bring their subjects to life. The entry on Reinhold Niebuhr succinctly conveys the essence of Christian Realism, and the chapter on Ram Dass movingly discusses the impact that his 1997 stroke had on his thinking about suffering and patience. But some of the entries are unsatisfying, even problematic. The discussion of C.S. Lewis, for example, is little more than a curriculum vitae in paragraph form; the author fails to convey what was distinctive about Lewis's work or why we should consider him an "innovator." The entry on Simone Weil praises the French activist as "a role model for everyone who has struggled honestly with faith in the face of mistrust of organized religion," but fails to mention, let alone account for, Weil's troubling record of anti-Semitic stances. The collection is, at times, stirring, but it serves better as an inspirational, agreeable read than as a reference book. The entries are too brief and uneven to be of use to the critical student. <br>Copyright 2002 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Thirty-six Games Kids Love to Play</h2><p>The games in this new book are designed to maximize fun and challenge while minimizing the risk of emotional and physical harm.

Teaching is a special skill requiring talent, instinct, passion, and organization. But while talent, instinct, and passion are inherent, organization must be acquired and can usually be found in a syllabus. <i>Teaching Graphic Design, Second Edition</i>, contains syllabi that are for all practicing designers and design educators who want to enhance their teaching skills and learn how experienced instructors and professors teach varied tools and impart the knowledge needed to be a designer in the current environment.<br><br> This second edition is newly revised to include more than thirty new syllabi by a wide range of professional teachers and teaching professionals who address the most current concerns of the graphic design industry, including product, strategic, entrepreneurial, and data design as well as the classic image, type, and layout disciplines. Some of the new syllabi included are:<br><br><li>Expressive Typography<br></li><li>Designer as Image Maker<br></li><li>Emerging Media Production<br></li><li>Branding<br></li><li>Corporate Design<br></li><li>Graphic Design and Visual Culture<br></li><li>Impact!

But for most teachers, having a syllabus is crucial to providing a high-quality learning experience. Wether hand-scribbled note or elaborate blueprint, the syllabus enables teachers to balance their personal vision with the requisites of the class, needs of the students, and expectations of the school. A new book by Steven Heller provides design educators with a powerful tool for creating course syllabi for any type of subject and learning level. Co-published with the School of Visual Arts by Allworth Press, Teaching Graphic Design brings together forty-six syllabi and course descriptions from leading educators throughout the U.S. </p><p>Heller, who sifted through several hundred syllabi before making his choice, praises educators for their cooperative attitude: "When asked to submit to this volume not one teacher balked. In fact, they were extremely anxious to share their methods with others in the educational community." The selection process was more difficult, requiring a careful balancing between traditional courses and innovative models, detailed instruction guides and inspirational outlines, standard versus "eccentric" styles. The result is a mix of syllabi complete with weekly breakdowns, projects, and selected readings. </p><p>With a focus on graphic design studio classes, the syllabi are divided into three sections&#x2014;undergraduate, graduate, and undergraduate and graduate levels&#x2014;and range from classic courses such as Typography I and Photoshop to more innovative courses such as web, film, and game design. Highlights featured in Teaching Graphic Design include </p><p>* "Flash Intensive" by Natalie Zee, Susan Harris, Anna McMillan, and Josh Ulm <br>* "Corporate Culture and Alternative Visions" by Maud Lavin and Sol Sender <br>* "Music Design" by Stefan Sagmeister <br>* "Service Learning: Connecting Community and Design" by Elisabeth Charman and Susan Agre-Kippenhan <br>* Graphic Design Thesis: A Survivor&#x2019;s Guide by Michael Vanderbyl, Leslie Becker, Jennifer Morla, Karen Fiss, Bob Aufuldish, and Mark Fox <br>* "Professional Practices in Design" by Terry Stone </p><p>"Knowing how other designers teach" is one of the most frequently expressed needs among today&#x2019;s design educators. With Teaching Graphic Design, designers have the opportunity to see how their peers across the U.S. manage to teach demanding subject matter, engage their students through meaningful assignments, meet the expectations of their schools, and keep themselves motivated.</p><b>Steven Heller</b> is the co-chair of the School of Visual Arts MFA Design / Designer as Author + Entrepreneur Program.

His <i>Dialogue on Ancient and Modern Music, </i>published in 1581 or 1582 and now translated into English for the first time, was among the most influential music treatises of his era.<br><br>Galilei is best known for his rejection of modern polyphonic music in favor of Greek monophonic song. The treatise sheds new light on his importance, both as a musician who advocated a new philosophy of music history and theory based on an objective search for the truth, and as an experimental scientist who was one of the founders of modern acoustics. <br></p><p>Music Theory Translation seriesThe late Claude V.

This book is a study of the transformation of the role of the pope in the twelfth century, from which he emerged as monarch of the universal Church, dedicated to reform and to making the Church independent of secular control. The most important role in the new model government was given to the cardinals, who hence forward were the principal advisers, agents and electors of the popes. These developments were accelerated by schism and political conflict: on three occasions the lawful pope was driven into exile by an antipope supported by a powerful secular ruler. Professor Robinson&#39;s text emphasizes the growing importance of the College of Cardinals and the practical aspects of papal government. It offers the most detailed analytical study yet available of this key period in the history of the western Church.</p><p>A study of the transformation of the papal system in the twelfth century, from which the pope emerged as monarch of the universal Church, dedicated to reform and to making the Church independent of secular control."Historians of the medieval church have long recognized the crucial character of the late eleventh and twelfth centuries for the history of the papacy. In this volume we have a superb treatment of the development and transformation of this institution. It effectively summarizes the state of current scholarship and, at the same time, provides independent interpretations which are cogent and reliable." Paul W. Knoll, Church History<br><br>"The work is unquestionably immensely valuable to students, and particularly teachers, of the mid-Middles Ages. Robinson's exhaustive treatment of all the matters he includes and his careful and complete notes to the original sources and to an immense body of secondary writing over the past century make it an unparalleled resource tool."

This variation introduces the derivative of the logarithmic and exponential functions at the same time as the polynomial functions and develops other transcendental functions prior to the introduction of the definite integral. In the Third Edition, Stewart retains the focus on problem solving, the meticulous accuracy, the patient explanations, and the carefully graded problems that have made this text work so well for a wide range of students. In the new edition, Stewart has increased his emphasis on technology and innovation and has expanded his focus on problem-solving and applications. On every page of his text, Stewart&#39;s genuine understanding of both calculus and calculus students is apparent. A phenomenon of the Stewart success is the text&#39;s use in such a wide variety of colleges and universities throughout the world. How does Stewart reach students at every level so effectively? Just as he teaches to every student in his classes from the most unprepared to the most mathematically gifted, Stewart write to this range of students--adding the explanations that make ideas come alive as well as the problems that challenge.</p><p>The late James Stewart received his M.S. from Stanford University and his Ph.D. from the University of Toronto.

As distant in time from the Five Books of Moses as Updike is from Shakespeare, these Late Biblical books are innovative, entertaining literary works. Women often stand center stage. The Song of Songs is a celebration of young love, frankly sensuous, with no reference to God or covenant. It offers some of the most beautiful love poems of the ancient world. The story of Queen Esther&#x2019;s shrewd triumph is also a secular entertainment, with clear traces of farce and sly sexual comedy. The character of Ruth embodies the virtues of loyalty, love, and charity in a harmonious world. Enigma replaces harmony in Daniel&#x2019;s feverish night dreams. The apocalyptic strangeness of Daniel echoes in works from the New Testament&#x2019;s Book of Revelations to the lyrics of Bob Dylan. And Jonah, the tale of a giant fish who, on God&#x2019;s command, swallows the prophet and imprisons him in his dark wet innards for three days, ends with a question that lingers, unanswered, leaving the reader to ponder the many limitations of humankind.</p><p>Robert Alter&#39;s translation of the Hebrew Bible, the magnificent capstone to a lifetime of distinguished scholarly work, has won the PEN Center Literary Award for Translation.

Potter</i>--and featuring characters such as Benjamin Franklin and Ethan Allen. In offering the manuscript to his publisher, Melville assured him, "I engage that the story shall contain nothing of any sort to shock the fastidious. There will be very little reflective writing in it; nothing weighty. It is adventure." This came as a relief, for his previous novel, <i>Pierre, </i>had shocked readers and brought down universal castigation.<br><br>This edition is an Approved Text of the Center for Editions of American Authors (Modern Language Association of America).<br></p><p>Melville&#39;s eighth book was begun as a simple rewrite of an obscure little narrative entitled Life and Remarkable Adventures of Israel R. Potter, in which Israel tells the story of his sad fall from Revolutionary hero to London peddler. Following its opening chapter Melville&#39;s novel retells that tale, with close adherence to the language and events of the Life, and then, shaking free of the original narrative, alternately moves between invented episodes and historical sources unrelated to the Life. Israel Potter is unique among Melville&#39;s books. It is the only one to be offered in the guise of literal biography, the tale presuming to offer an accurate life history of the man Israel Potter who did in fact fight at Bunker Hill. It is also Melville&#39;s only historical novel: it presents famous men of the American Revolution - Benjamin Franklin, John Paul Jones, Ethan Allen, and others - in situations that are a matter of historical record.<p>Herman Melville (August 1, 1819 &#x2013; September 28, 1891) was an American novelist, short story writer, essayist, and poet. He is best known for his novel Moby-Dick. His first three books gained much contemporary attention (the first, Typee, becoming a bestseller), and after a fast-blooming literary success in the late 1840s, his popularity declined precipitously in the mid-1850s and never recovered during his lifetime. When he died in 1891, he was almost completely forgotten. It was not until the "Melville Revival" in the early 20th century that his work won recognition, especially Moby-Dick, which was hailed as one of the literary masterpieces of both American and world literature. He was the first writer to have his works collected and published by the Library of America.</p></p><h2>The Virtuoso Flute-Player (Cambridge Musical Texts and Monographs)</h2><p>This is an English translation of Tutor for Playing the Flute (1791) by Johann George Tromlitz.

Channeling Eisner's <em>The Spirit</em>, along with the likes of Hammett, Chandler, Cain, John Huston, and Billy Wilder, and spiced with the deft humor for which Feiffer is renowned, <em>Kill My Mother</em> centers on five formidable women from two unrelated families, linked fatefully and fatally by a has-been, hard-drinking private detective.</p><p>As our story begins, we meet Annie Hannigan, an out-of-control teenager, jitterbugging in the 1930s. Annie dreams of offing her mother, Elsie, whom she blames for abandoning her for a job soon after her husband, a cop, is shot and killed. Now, employed by her husband&#x2019;s best friend&#x2015;an over-the-hill and perpetually soused private eye&#x2015;Elsie finds herself covering up his missteps as she is drawn into a case of a mysterious client, who leads her into a decade-long drama of deception and dual identities sprawling from the Depression era to World War II Hollywood and the jungles of the South Pacific.</p><p>Along with three femme fatales, an obsessed daughter, and a loner heroine, <em>Kill My Mother</em> features a fighter turned tap dancer, a small-time thug who dreams of being a hit man, a name-dropping cab driver, a communist liquor&nbsp;store owner, and a hunky movie star with a mind-boggling secret. Culminating in a U.S.O. tour on a war-torn Pacific island, this disparate band of old enemies congregate to settle scores.</p><p>In a drawing style derived from <em>Steve Canyon</em> and <em>The Spirit</em>, Feiffer combines his long-honed skills as cartoonist, playwright, and screenwriter to draw us into this seductively menacing world where streets are black with soot and rain, and base motives and betrayal are served on the rocks in bars unsafe to enter.

Ramachandra Guha takes as his point of departure the dominant environmental philosophies in these two countries&#x2015;identified as "agrarianism" in India and "wilderness thinking" in the U.S. Proposing an inclusive "social ecology" framework that goes beyond these partisan ideologies, Guha arrives at a richer understanding of controversies over large dams, state forests, wildlife reserves, and more. He offers trenchant critiques of privileged and isolationist proponents of conservation, persuasively arguing for biospheres that care as much for humans as for other species. He also provides profiles of three remarkable environmental thinkers and activists&#x2015;Lewis Mumford, Chandi Prasad Bhatt, and Madhav Gadgil.

First composed by the Maharishi Vyasa in verse, it has come down the centuries in the timeless oral tradition of guru and sishya, profoundly influencing the history, culture, and art of not only the Indian subcontinent but most of south-east Asia. At 100,000 couplets, it is seven times as long as the Iliad and the Odyssey combined: far and away the greatest recorded epic known to man.The Mahabharata is the very Book of Life: in its variety, majesty and, also, in its violence and tragedy. It has been said that nothing exists that cannot be found within the pages of this awesome legend. The epic describes a great war of some 5000 years ago, and the events that led to it. The war on Kurukshetra sees ten million warriors slain, brings the dwapara yuga to an end, and ushers in a new and sinister age: this present kali yuga, modern times.At the heart of the Mahabharata nestles the Bhagavad Gita, the Song of God. Senayor ubhayor madhye, between two teeming armies, Krishna expounds the eternal dharma to his warrior of light, Arjuna. At one level, all the restless action of the Mahabharata is a quest for the Gita and its sacred stillness. After the carnage, it is the Gita that survives, immortal lotus floating upon the dark waters of desolation: the final secret!With its magnificent cast of characters, human, demonic, and divine, and its riveting narrative, the Mahabharata continues to enchant readers and scholars the world over. This new rendering brings the epic to the contemporary reader in sparkling modern prose. It brings alive all the excitement, magic, and grandeur of the original-for our times.</p><p>Ramesh Menon was born in 1951 in New Delhi.

Murphy grounds his views on careful analysis of the nature of forgiveness, a subtle understanding of the psychology of anger and resentment, and a fine appreciation of the ethical issues of self-respect and self-defense. He also uses accessible examples from law, literature, and religion to make his points. Providing a nuanced approach to a proper understanding of the place of our strongest emotions in moral, political, and personal life, and using lucid, easily understood prose, this volume is a classic example of philosophical thinking applied to a thorny, everyday problem.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jeffrie G. Murphy</strong> is Regents Professor of Law and Philosophy and Affiliated Professor of Religious Studies at Arizona State University. He is the author of numerous books and articles on legal and moral philosophy, with a particular emphasis on theories of punishment, mercy, forgiveness, and the moral emotions.<br>"Getting Even is probably the best book to date on the costs and benefits of forgiveness."--First Things<br><br>"Getting Even: Forgiveness and Its Limits is a well-written and accessible yet deepy serious examination of the costs of forgiveness and the dangers of cheap grace."--First Things<br><br>"Jeffrie Murphy has written a wonderful and sensitive book on an almost forbidden topic, the topic of revenge. But it is also a book about forgiveness, and it is striking a judicious balance between these two that makes Murphy's book such a challenge and a success. Unlike the herd of authors<br>writing on forgiveness, he suggests difficult objections and deep reasons for reservation. But neither does his book display real enthusiasm for revenge, although he gives it a good run and 'two cheers.' If the book ends up with a rather Christian account of forgiveness that will please many<br>readers, Murphy takes them through some psychologically difficult but philosophically clear and very readable terrain to get there."--Robert C. Solomon, Quincy Lee Centennial Professor and Distinguished Teaching Professor, The University of Texas at Austin<br><br>"In a voice that is reasonable, incisively witty, finely tuned to human emotion, and wise, Murphy teaches us how to think about our most difficult moral dilemmas. When should we forgive? When might it be healthy to hold a grudge? We would all do well to think through these questions from both<br>a personal and moral perspective with this thoughtful and fascinating meditation."--Sharon Lamb, Professor of Psychology, St. Michael's College, author of The Secret Lives of Girls and The Trouble with Blame<br><br>"Jeffrie Murphy has been a distinctive voice in the discussion of how we should respond to wrongdoing (our own and others'): a humane, philosophically astute, morally sensitive and imaginative voice that reminds us of the merits as well as the dangers of such often deprecated responses as<br>anger, resentment and a desire to 'get even', and that brings out the difficulty as well as the significance of such responses as forgiveness, mercy and repentance. Anyone who cares about how we should respond, whether morally or legally, to the wrongs and evils that we do to each other-that is to<br>say, anyone who aspires to be either a moral agent or a citizen--will find stimulation and sustenance in this book."--R.A.

D. Nuttall&#x2019;s study of Shakespeare&#x2019;s intellectual preoccupations is a literary tour de force and comes to crown the distinguished career of a Shakespeare scholar. Certain questions engross Shakespeare from his early plays to the late romances: the nature of motive, cause, personal identity and relation, the proper status of imagination, ethics and subjectivity, language and its capacity to occlude and to communicate.&nbsp;Yet Shakespeare&#x2019;s thought, Nuttall demonstrates, is anything but static. The plays keep returning to, modifying, and complicating his creative preoccupations. Nuttall allows us to hear and appreciate the emergent cathedral choir of play speaking to play. By the later stages of Nuttall&#x2019;s book this choir is nearly overwhelming in its power and dimensions. The author does not limit discussion to moments of crucial intellection but gives himself ample space in which to get at the distinctive <i>essence</i> of each work.<br><br> Much recent historicist criticism has tended to &#x201c;flatten&#x201d; Shakespeare by confining him to the thought-clich�s of his time, and this in its turn has led to an implicitly patronizing view of him as unthinkingly racist, sexist, and so on. Nuttall shows us that, on the contrary, Shakespeare proves again and again to be more intelligent and perceptive than his 21st-century readers. This book challenges us to reconsider the relation of great literature to its social and historical matrix. It is also, perhaps, the best guide to Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays available in English.</p><p>Q: In recent years there has been a trend of very senior scholars writing big, ambitious books about Shakespeare for the general reader&#x2014;Stephen Greenblatt's and James Shapiro's biographies, and Harold Bloom's and Sir Frank Kermode's studies. And now A. D. Nuttall of Oxford enters the fray. What more can be said about Shakespeare that hasn't already been said?&nbsp; How is this book different?<br>&nbsp;<br>A: First, this isn't a biography&#x2014;of the titles mentioned, the Bloom and the Kermode come closest. But my book is more intently engaged with ideas and with (dramatically conducted) argument than any of these. Everyone knows that Shakespeare excels in imagination and rhetorical power. This book argues that he was also very intelligent&#x2014;both philosophically and psychologically. There are certain questions that fascinate Shakespeare, and he returns to them repeatedly, but in always new and different ways.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Q: In pursuit of Shakespeare's thought and particular preoccupations, you follow the plays in chronological order, is that right?<br>&nbsp;<br>A: Yes, but only roughly in chronological order. I broke with chronology if, say, a certain play was closely linked <i>in argument</i> with another but was written some time before. In a sense, though, it was Shakespeare himself&nbsp;who determined the exact sequence in which I took up the plays for consideration.<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><i>Q: Shakespeare the Thinker</i> seems to me an extremely personal book, more personal than any of your previous books. Do you think that's a fair statement?<br>&nbsp;<br>A: Well, this book comes after a lifetime of thinking about, and teaching, Shakespeare. You wondered, earlier, whether it's possible to say anything new about Shakespeare. I'm quite sure it is. I have taught Shakespeare for many years--and each year was completely different from the one before. With Shakespeare, one always finds more. Among other things I hope the book demonstrates something of the distinctive <i>essence</i> of each play. I wanted to provide an introduction to the plays&#x2014;and to do it without compromising&#x2014;without ever pretending that Shakespeare is simpler or shallower than he really is.&nbsp;<b>A. D.

Her bestselling Dragonriders of Pern� series is counted among the masterpieces of modern science fiction, a work whose popularity continues to grow as new generations of readers discover the literary magic only Anne McCaffrey can provide. Now that magic is back, displayed as breathtakingly as ever in the exciting and long-awaited addition to McCaffrey's classic Pegasus series&#x2014;and the perfect link to her bestselling Tower and Hive saga . . .<br><br>PEGASUS IN SPACE<br><br>For an overpopulated Earth whose resources are strained to the breaking point, there is only one place to look for relief: straight up. With the successful completion of the Padrugoi Space Station, humanity has at last achieved its first large-scale permanent presence in space. Additional bases are feverishly being built on the Moon and on Mars, stepping stones to the greatest adventure in all history: the colonization of alien worlds. Already long-range telescopes have identified a number of habitable planets orbiting the stars of distant galaxies. Now it's just a question of getting there.<br><br>But there are those who, for selfish motives of their own, want Padrugoi and the other outposts to fail. People who will stop at nothing to maintain their power or to revenge its loss. Standing in their way are the Talented, men and women gifted with extraordinary mental powers that have made them as feared as they are respected&#x2014;and utterly indispensable to the colonization effort.<br><br>There is Peter Reidinger, a teenage paraplegic who happens to be the strongest telekinetic ever, his mind capable of teleporting objects and people thousands of miles in the blink of an eye. Yet all his power cannot repair his damaged spine or allow him to feel the gentle touch of a loved one . . . Rhyssa Owen, the powerful telepath and mother hen to Peter and the rest of her "children"&#x2014;and a fierce, unrelenting fighter against the prejudice that would deny the Talented the right to lead happy and productive lives . . . and Amariyah, an orphan girl who loves two things in the world above all others: gardening and Peter Reidinger. And woe to anyone who harms either one of them&#x2014;for the young girl's talent may prove to be the most amazing of all.<br><br>Now, as sabotage and attempted murder strike the Station, it's up to the Talented to save the day. Only who's going to save the Talented?</p><p>Anne McCaffrey is best known for <i>The Dragonriders of Pern</i>, but her loose Talents series about superpsychics has been running almost as long. It began with the near-future <i>To Ride Pegasus</i>, continuing a couple of generations later in <i>Pegasus in Flight</i>. Book 2 introduced a crowd of new characters, notably the paralyzed boy Peter whose telekinetic talent can move not only his body without help from his ruined nervous system, but--with practice--even lift payloads into orbit.<p> <i>Pegasus in Space</i> follows directly, with mayhem and mutiny, at the opening of a manned space station, which Peter and talented friends helped build. Further hassles ensue during his training for space haulage work: obstructive bureaucrats, crooked suppliers, murder attempts, and skillful sabotage. McCaffrey specializes in feel-good adventure SF, full of romance, warm friendships, and hearty meals. Somehow her villains never quite convince, though, and their evil deeds are so rapidly annulled that the story rarely builds up much suspense. Meanwhile, the orphan girl Amiriyah who's adopted into Peter's family has a mysterious, subtle talent of her own, one that we soon guess will change his life. Our young hero's ambitions foreshadow later far-future books in the series (beginning with <i>The Rowan</i>) in which "kinetics" hurl cargo across huge interstellar gulfs. While most people think his talent needs careful conservation, Peter has already teleported supplies to the moon and has secret plans for Mars, the asteroids, and the moons of Jupiter. It all makes for an agreeable, lightweight read. <i>--David Langford, Amazon.co.uk</i></p><br>"McCaffrey's world of the Talented is as vivid as that of Pern and its dragons."<br>--Publishers Weekly<br><br>"[McCaffrey is] a master of the well-told tale."<br>--Chicago Sun-Times</p><h2>More Die of Heartbreak</h2><p>Kenneth Trachtenberg, the witty and eccentric narrator of <i>More Die of Heartbreak</i>, has left his native Paris for the Midwest.

Shipped from the U.K. All orders received before 3pm sent that weekday.</p><p>King Leopold of Belgium, writes historian Adam Hochschild in this grim history, did not much care for his native land or his subjects, all of which he dismissed as "small country, small people." Even so, he searched the globe to find a colony for Belgium, frantic that the scramble of other European powers for overseas dominions in Africa and Asia would leave nothing for himself or his people. When he eventually found a suitable location in what would become the Belgian Congo, later known as Zaire and now simply as Congo, Leopold set about establishing a rule of terror that would culminate in the deaths of 4 to 8 million indigenous people, "a death toll," Hochschild writes, "of Holocaust dimensions." Those who survived went to work mining ore or harvesting rubber, yielding a fortune for the Belgian king, who salted away billions of dollars in hidden bank accounts throughout the world. Hochschild's fine book of historical inquiry, which draws heavily on eyewitness accounts of the colonialists' savagery, brings this little-studied episode in European and African history into new light. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i>Adam Hocshchild is an award-winning author and journalist, who also teaches journalism at the University of California at Berkeley.

The second edition also features 18 extensive new examples of shaders and their underlying algorithms, including</p> <ul> <li>Image-based lighting</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Lighting with spherical harmonics</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Ambient occlusion</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Shadow mapping</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Volume shadows using deferred lighting</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Ward's BRDF model</li> </ul> <p>The color plate section illustrates the power and sophistication of the OpenGL Shading Language. The API Function Reference at the end of the book is an excellent guide to the API entry points that support the OpenGL Shading Language. Also included is a convenient Quick Reference Card to GLSL. <br> <br></p></p><p><p> <b>Randi Rost</b> is an ISV Manager in the Software and Solutions Group at Intel. Previously he held several positions at 3Dlabs, Inc., the company that led the creation of the OpenGL Shading Language (GLSL). Randi was a core contributor to the development of GLSL and the OpenGL API that supports it, as well as one of the first programmers to design and implement shaders using this technology.</p><p>For just about as long as there has been graphics hardware, there has been programmable graphics hardware. Over the years, building flexibility into graphics hardware designs has been a necessary way of life for hardware developers. Graphics APIs continue to evolve, and because a hardware design can take two years or more from start to finish, the only way to guarantee a hardware product that can support the then current graphics APIs at its release is to build in some degree of programmability from the very beginning.</p> <p>Until recently, the realm of programming graphics hardware belonged to just a few people, mainly researchers and graphics hardware driver developers. Research into programmable graphics hardware has been taking place for many years, but the point of this research has not been to produce viable hardware and software for application developers and end users. The graphics hardware driver developers have focused on the immediate task of providing support for the important graphics APIs of the time: PHIGS, PEX, Iris GL, OpenGL, Direct3D, and so on. Until recently, none of these APIs exposed the programmability of the underlying hardware, so application developers have been forced into using the fixed functionality provided by traditional graphics APIs.</p> <p>Hardware companies have not exposed the programmable underpinnings of their products because of the high cost of educating and supporting customers to use low-level, device-specific interfaces, and because these interfaces typically change quite radically with each new generation of graphics hardware. Application developers who use such a device-specific interface to a piece of graphics hardware face the daunting task of updating their software for each new generation of hardware that comes along. And forget about supporting the application on hardware from multiple vendors!</p> <p>As we moved into the 21st century, some of these fundamental tenets about graphics hardware were challenged. Application developers pushed the envelope as never before and demanded a variety of new features in hardware in order to create more and more sophisticated onscreen effects. As a result, new graphics hardware designs became more programmable than ever before. Standard graphics APIs were challenged to keep up with the pace of hardware innovation. For OpenGL, the result was a spate of extensions to the core API as hardware vendors struggled to support a range of interesting new features that their customers were demanding. </p> <p>The creation of a standard, cross-platform, high-level shading language for commercially available graphics hardware was a watershed event for the graphics industry. A paradigm shift occurred, one that took us from the world of rigid, fixed functionality graphics hardware and graphics APIs to a brave new world where the visual processing unit, or VPU (i.e., graphics hardware), is as important as the central processing unit, or CPU. The VPU is optimized for processing dynamic media such as 3D graphics and video. Highly parallel processing of floating-point data is the primary task for VPUs, and the flexibility of the VPU means that it can also be used to process data other than a stream of traditional graphics commands. Applications can take advantage of the capabilities of both the CPU and the VPU, using the strengths of each to optimally perform the task at hand.</p> <p>This book describes how graphics hardware programmability is exposed through a high-level language in the leading cross-platform 3D graphics API: OpenGL. This language, the OpenGL Shading Language, lets applications take total control over the most important stages of the graphics processing pipeline. No longer restricted to the graphics rendering algorithms and formulas chosen by hardware designers and frozen in silicon, software developers are beginning to use this programmability to create stunning effects in real time. </p> <p><b>Intended Audience</b></p> <p>The primary audience for this book is application programmers who want to write shaders. This book can be used as both a tutorial and a reference book by people interested in learning to write shaders with the OpenGL Shading Language. Some will use the book in one fashion, and some in the other. The organization is amenable to both uses and is based on the assumption that most people won't read the book in sequential order from back to front (but some intrepid readers of the first edition reported that they did just that!).</p> <p>Readers do not need previous knowledge of OpenGL to absorb the material in this book, but such knowledge is very helpful. A brief review of OpenGL is included, but this book does not attempt to be a tutorial or reference book for OpenGL. Anyone attempting to develop an OpenGL application that uses shaders should be armed with OpenGL programming documentation in addition to this book.</p> <p>Computer graphics has a mathematical basis, so some knowledge of algebra, trigonometry, and calculus will help readers understand and appreciate some of the details presented. With the advent of programmable graphics hardware, key parts of the graphics processing pipeline are once again under the control of software developers. To develop shaders successfully in this environment, developers must understand the mathematical basis of computer graphics.</p> <p><b>About This Book</b></p> <p>This book has three main parts. Chapters 1 through 8 teach the reader about the OpenGL Shading Language and how to use it. This part of the book covers details of the language and details of the OpenGL commands that create and manipulate shaders. To supply a basis for writing shaders, Chapters 9 through 20 contain a gallery of shader examples and some explanation of the underlying algorithms. This part of the book is both the baseline for a reader's shader development and a springboard for inspiring new ideas. Finally, Chapter 21 compares other notable commercial shading languages, and Appendices A and B contain reference material for the language and the API entry points that support it.</p> <p>The chapters are arranged to suit the needs of the reader who is least familiar with OpenGL and shading languages. Certain chapters can be skipped by readers who are more familiar with both topics. This book has somewhat compartmentalized chapters in order to allow such usage. </p> <ul> <li>Chapter 1 reviews the fundamentals of the OpenGL API. Readers already familiar with OpenGL may skip to Chapter 2.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 2 introduces the OpenGL Shading Language and the OpenGL entry points that have been added to support it. If you want to know what the OpenGL Shading Language is all about and you have time to read only two chapters of this book, this chapter and Chapter 3 are the ones to read.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 3 thoroughly describes the OpenGL Shading Language. This material is organized to present the details of a programming language. This section serves as a useful reference section for readers who have developed a general understanding of the language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 4 discusses how the newly defined programmable parts of the rendering pipeline interact with each other and with OpenGL's fixed functionality. This discussion includes descriptions of the built-in variables defined in the OpenGL Shading Language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 5 describes the built-in functions that are part of the OpenGL Shading Language. This section is a useful reference section for readers with an understanding of the language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 6 presents and discusses a fairly simple shader example. People who learn best by diving in and studying a real example will benefit from the discussion in this chapter.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 7 describes the entry points that have been added to OpenGL to support the creation and manipulation of shaders. Application programmers who want to use shaders in their application must understand this material.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 8 presents some general advice on shader development and describes the shader development process. It also describes tools that are currently available to aid the shader development process.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 9 begins a series of chapters that present and discuss shaders with a common characteristic. In this chapter, shaders that duplicate some of the fixed functionality of the OpenGL pipeline are presented.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 10 presents a few shaders that are based on the capability to store data in and retrieve data from texture maps.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 11 is devoted to shaders that are procedural in nature; that is, effects are computed algorithmically rather than being based on information stored in textures.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 12 presents several alternative lighting models that can be implemented with OpenGL shaders.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 13 discusses algorithms and shaders for producing shadows.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 14 delves into the details of shaders that implement more realistic surface characteristics, including refraction, diffraction, and more realistic reflection.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 15 describes noise and the effects that can be achieved with its proper use.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 16 contains examples of how shaders can create rendering effects that vary over time.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 17 contains a discussion of the aliasing problem and how shaders can be written to reduce the effects of aliasing.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 18 illustrates shaders that achieve effects other than photorealism. Such effects include technical illustration, sketching or hatching effects, and other stylized rendering.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 19 presents several shaders that modify images as they are being drawn with OpenGL.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 20 describes some of the techniques and algorithms used in a complex OpenGL application that makes extensive use of the OpenGL Shading Language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Chapter 21 compares the OpenGL Shading Language with other notable commercial shading languages.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Appendix A contains the language grammar that more clearly specifies the OpenGL Shading Language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Appendix B contains reference pages for the API entry points that are related to the OpenGL Shading Language.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Finally, Glossary collects terms defined in the book, Further Reading gathers all the chapter references and adds more, and Index ends the book.</li> </ul> <p><b>About the Shader Examples</b></p> <p>The shaders contained in this book are primarily short programs that illustrate the capabilities of the OpenGL Shading Language. None of the example shaders should be presumed to illustrate the "best" way of achieving a particular effect. (Indeed, the "best" way to implement certain effects may have yet to be discovered through the power and flexibility of programmable graphics hardware.) Performance improvements for each shader are possible for any given hardware target. For most of the shaders, image quality may be improved if greater care is taken to reduce or eliminate causes of aliasing. </p> <p>The source code for these shaders is written in a way that I believe represents a reasonable trade-off between source code clarity, portability, and performance. Use them to learn the OpenGL Shading Language, and improve on them for use in your own projects.</p> <p>All the images produced for this book were done either on the first graphics accelerator to provide support for the OpenGL Shading Language, the 3Dlabs Wildcat VP, or its successor, the 3Dlabs Wildcat Realizm. I have taken as much care as possible to present shaders that are done "the right way" for the OpenGL Shading Language rather than those with idiosyncrasies from their development on the very early implementations of the OpenGL Shading Language. Electronic versions of most of these shaders are available through a link at this book's Web site at http://3dshaders.com.</p> <p><b>Errata</b></p> <p>I know that this book contains some errors, but I've done my best to keep them to a minimum.

Yet it is only through using such an apparently illogical and subversive method that the pathological structures in thinking can be penetrated and the self underneath revealed and worked with by the analyst.<br> Christopher Bollas focuses on the nature and effects of the free associative process. Using clinical studies, he highlights how aspects such as mental illness, and creative or artistic acts can reveal much about the self.</p><p><strong>Christopher Bollas</strong> is a psychoanalyst in private practice in London.

As an orphan living on New Moon Farm, writing helped her face the difficult, lonely times. But now all her friends are going away to high school in nearby Shrewsbury, and her old-fashioned, tyrannical aunt Elizabeth will only let her go if she promises to stop writng! All the same, this is the first step in Emily&#39;s climb to success. Once in town, Emily&#39;s activities set the Shrewsbury gossips buzzing. But Emily and her friends are confident -- Ilse&#39;s a born actress, Teddy&#39;s set to be a great artist, and roguish Perry has the makings of a brilliant lawyer. When Emily has her poems published and writes for the town newspaper, success seems to be on its way -- and with it the first whispers of romance. Then Emily is offered a fabulous opportunity, and she must decide if she wants to change her life forever.L.M.

Something thrown, for us to catch? A lurch, meant to unsettle us? The relative position of a tone on a scale? A speech designed to persuade? This book is an invitation to the life of philosophy in the United States, as Emerson once lived it and as Stanley Cavell now lives it - in all its topographical ambiguity. Cavell talks about his vocation in connection with what he calls voice - the tone of philosophy - and his right to take that tone, and to describe an anecdotal journey toward the discovery of his own voice. Cavell asks how the voice of philosophy can be heard amid the commerce of everyday life. His autobiographical exercises begin at home with his parents, his father an accidental pawnbroker and accomplished raconteur, his mother a trained and talented musician. In the course of showing us his certain steps in the discovery of his trade, he conveys the sense of what it means to learn to walk on one&#39;s own, with a Thoreauvian deliberateness. He pays suitable attention to a serious ally and antagonist to the task of philosophy as he understands it, namely, Jacques Derrida - yet Derrida has mounted a full-scale attack on &#34;voice&#34; and other concepts that Cavell has held open for much of a lifetime. The chapters are interwoven with intense family reminiscences in Cavell&#39;s discovery of J. L. Austin, his understanding of Wittgenstein, his raising of Emerson to the philosophical canon, his fascination with film (images of women in a medium for women), the revelation that film and opera are the media of otherness for women. And the voice at the end: hearing in himself the voice of his mother, which is music. Complex, sentimental, witty, A Pitch ofPhilosophy is for anyone who cares to take on philosophy, under whatever name it goes.Stanley Cavell is Walter M. Cabot Professor of Aesthetics and the General Theory of Value, Emeritus, at Harvard University.</p><h2>A Short Course in Photography (8th Edition)</h2><p><b>&nbsp;</b> <p>The London, Upton, Stone series has helped over 1,000,000 photography students capture their potential.</p> <p>The new 8th edition of <i>A Short Course in Photography </i>introduces students to the fundamentals of photography and suggests ways in which they might create photographs that have meaning.

Educating Hearts and Minds, a portrait of Japanese preschool and early elementary education, offers a fresh perspective on these questions. Its thesis--which will surprise many Americans--is that Japanese schools are successful because they meet children&#39;s needs for friendship, belonging, and contribution. This book brings to life what actually happens inside Japanese classrooms. In a sharp departure from most previous accounts, this book suggests that Japanese education succeeds because all children--not just the brightest or best-behaved--somehow come to feel like valued members of the school community. Ironically, Japanese teachers credit John Dewey and other progressive Western educators for many of the techniques that make Japanese schools both caring and challenging, but that never caught on in this country. This book brings to Americans the voices of Japanese classroom teachers--voices that are at once deeply consonant with American aspirations and deeply provocative.</p><p>In a sharp departure from most previous accounts, this portrait of Japanese preschool and early elementary education offers a fresh perspective by suggesting that Japanese education succeeds because all children somehow come to feel like valued members of the school community."...a major contribution to the study of early childhood education. This book is useful in a wide variety of instructional settings: from basic courses on Japanese culture to introductory education classes.

Focusing on the interplay of gender and attire, the authors conclude that "certain symbols resist change stubbornly," just as ideas of masculinity and femininity do, and offer multiple illuminating examples. Their comprehensive, succinct discussion of the many facets of dress and sexual roles treats the clothing of children, wardrobes worn on the job, fads and experiments (e.g., bloomers, a 19th century precursor of feminine trousers). Illustrated. <br>Copyright 1989 Reed Business Information, Inc.The editors have assembled the most remarkable book on the history of fashion available today. More than just a history, it analyzes what changes in fashion say about gender, class, and morality, noting, for example, that the point at which parents begin dressing children specifically as girls or boys has changed over time. Pink and blue have not always held the connotations they do today: until about 1920 reds and pinks were considered masculine and blues feminine. Changing hair styles and body types are also examined, with the medieval preference for slenderness and the Renaissance ideal of solidity and weight duly acknowledged. The book also covers work clothes, sports clothes, military uniforms, blue jeans, and lingerie. A concise and lively book that works on all levels, for casual reader or scholar.

Comparing the Gusii people of Kenya with the American white middle class, the authors show how divergent cultural priorities create differing conditions for early childhood development. Combining the perspectives of social anthropology, pediatrics, and developmental psychology, the authors demonstrate how child care customs can be responsive to varied socioeconomic, demographic, and cultural conditions without inflicting harm on children. This text will be of interest to researchers in child development and anthropology.</p><p>This examination of parenthood, infancy, and early childhood in an African community raises questions about normal child care.

A classic study of the development of drug laws in the U.S., the book examines the relations between public outcry and the creation of prohibitive drug laws from the end of the Civil War to the present day. (Originally published in 1973, the book is now updated by the addition of a new chapter and introduction to cover developments in the past 15 years.)<br> According to Dr. Musto, Americans' attitudes toward drugs have followed a cyclic pattern of tolerance and restraint. Marshalling an impressive amount of evidence, he supports the theory that acceptance wanes over a 20 to 30-year period of extensive drug use and is followed by a period of intolerance, during which there is a danger of excessive restraints and false links between drug use and feared minorities. At the turn of the century, when cocaine changed suddenly from the all-American tonic to the most feared of all drugs, it was linked to fears of black Americans. Racial tensions in the American South increased, lynchings reached a peak, and law officers increased the caliber of their guns. Proponents of the closing of opiate-maintenance clinics, who succeeded with a 1919 Supreme Court decision outlawing the maintenance of "drug fiends," wildly exaggerated the number of drug users and linked them to feared immigrant groups such as the Chinese. The first federal anti-marijuana law, in 1937, was partly a response to the threat of laid-off Mexican farm workers, who cultivated the plant for personal use.<br> In detailing the connection between waves of public repulsion and narcotics control, Musto examines American foreign policy and the role played by physicians and the emerging pharmaceutical industry. While not prescriptive, his book offers needed insights as we enter yet another phase of drug intolerance--the second this century. Musto raises critical questions lawmakers and other citizens must consider as they devise ways of curbing drug use while avoiding the sort of Draconian overkill that has in the past set the stage for a reactionary wave of drug enthusiasm. In particular, he expresses concern over the potential for drug testing to be overzealously applied in an attempt to "eliminate" drug abuse from American society.</p><p><br><em>About the Author</em>:<br><strong>David F. Musto, M.D.</strong>, a well-known authority on drug abuse, is Professor of Psychiatry and the History of Medicine at the Yale School of Medicine.<br><br><strong>"Musto makes a persuasive case for thoughtful deliberation when framing a policy against the use and abuse of drugs.

While international travel, heroism, and danger are all part of the job description, the fundamentals of counterintelligence are discipline, skill, and&#x2014;well&#x2014;intelligence. CI operations include conducting investigations, offensive and defensive operations, security and vulnerability analyses, and intelligence collection in peace and at all levels of conflict to support command needs. This guide serves to inform commanders, agents, and analysts on how to identify, neutralize, and exploit any foreign attempts to conduct operations against the U.S. Army.&nbsp;<br>Find out how CI operatives combat terrorism, create battlefield deception, and inform all echelons of combat of both real and potential threats from the U.S. Army's own guide to counterintelligence. The tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTP) outlined are the same instructions that CI personnel follow in the field. As the world becomes more interconnected and as technological advances continue to be made, proper CI techniques are exceedingly critical to the protection of the U.S. Army. Counterintelligence is not just the subject for an entertaining story, it is how peacekeeping, humanitarian, and counter-drug operations are carried out in this globalized world.</p><p>The CIA is at the top of a cosmology of government and private concerns known collectively as the intelligence community. One of the most important components of this community is the U.S. Army Intelligence Center. Its mission is to provide information to commanders at all levels in the U.S. Army so that they are able to determine the capabilities of a foreign foe or act quickly on accurate, up-to-date intelligence. Now for the first time ever, the recently declassified U.S. Army Counterintelligence Handbook provides a rare look into the specialized and secretive world of military intelligence and counterintelligence procedure. <br>Counterintelligence comprises efforts to determine what the enemy knows, efforts to keep friendly intelligence secret, and efforts to hamper the enemy&#x2019;s ability to collect and use intelligence. In this manual, the first four chapters provide counterintelligence information to the commander and his staff, while the remaining chapters cover the nuts and bolts of counterintelligence operations. <br>The book includes everything from conducting background investigations to using field artillery to destroy stations. There is general information, for instance, on evaluating assassination threats, contacting members of friendly resistance organizations, and how best to handle moles. There is advice on checking and keeping files, conducting searches, and the administration of lie detector tests. Also detailed are the ethics, legalities, and practical concerns of placing bugs, tapping telephones, and setting up listening posts for wireless intercepts, as well as the use of cameras and recorders. There is also information on tracking and connecting members of groups or cells, with advice on creating diagrams to illustrate the relationship among targets. <br>The U.S. Army Counterintelligence Handbook is a must-read for anyone with an interest in today&#x2019;s difficult military intelligence questions, and it provides answers right from the source. <br> <br> <br>The U.S. <strong>Department of the Army</strong> is headquartered at the Pentagon in Arlington, Virginia, and authors <em>The Soldier's Guide</em>, <em>The Complete Guide to Edible Wild Plants</em>, <em>U.S. Army Ranger Handbook</em>, <em>U.S. Army Hand-to-Hand Combat</em>, <em>U.S. Army First Aid Manual</em>, <em>U.S. Army Weapons Systems</em>, <em>U.S. Army Special Forces Handbook</em>, <em>U.S. Army Guide to Boobytraps</em>, <em>U.S. Army Explosives and Demolitions Handbook</em>, <em>U.S. Army Special Forces Guide to Unconventional Warfare</em>, and <em>U.S. Army Special Forces Medical Handbook</em>.</p><h2>China&#39;s Political System (9th Edition)</h2><p><b> <i> <b>A concise introduction to the political, economic, and social factors that determine China&#x2019;s government</b> </i> </b> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>Highly respected specialist June Teufel Dreyer offers expert analysis of the challenges facing China&#x2019;s economic, legal, military, social, and cultural institutions while examining the historical context and current trends.&nbsp; <i>China&#x2019;s Political System </i>asks readers to think about the broader problem of governance in China by comprehensively showing how the past and present impact leaders, citizens, ethnic minorities, and policies.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p> <b>Note:</b> <b>This is just the standalone book.&nbsp;</b>&nbsp;</p></p><p><p> <b>June Teufel Dreyer </b>is Professor of Political Science at the University of Miami, Coral Gables, Florida, a past commissioner of the congressionally established U.S.-China Economic and Security Review Commission, and a fellow of the Foreign Policy Research Institute.

In Chapters 1 and 2 I discuss historical examples of "rumor" discourse and suggest whey many blacks have--for good reason--channeled beliefs about race relations into familiar formulae, ones developed as early as the time of the first contact between sub-Saharan Africans and European white. Then in Chapters 3-7 it explores the continuation of these issues in late-twentieth-century African-American rumors and contemporary legends, using examples collected in the field. Because Turner was able to monitor these contemporary legends as they unfolded and played themselves out, rigorous analysis was possible.&nbsp;What follows, then, is an examination of the themes common to these contemporary items and related historical ones, and an explanation for their persistence. Concerns about conspiracy, contamination, cannibalism, and castration--perceived threats to individual black bodies, which are then translated into animosity toward the race as a whole--run through nearly four hundred years of black contemporary legend material and prove remarkable tenacious.&nbsp;</p><p>"A feast for those interested in historical and modern black folklore and for both supporters and critics of conspiracy theory."--William H. Banks, Jr., <i>Quarterly Black Review of Books</i>&nbsp;"A compelling read. . . . Through sleuth-like research of rumor and myth in African-American culture, Turner uncovers perhaps the biggest conspiracy of all: centuries of systematic racism in the United States. She traces the history of black folklore in this country from the moment the first slave ships arrived to the present day, repeatedly providing powerful evidence that the African-American fear of white America is not simply unfounded cultural paranoia."--Erik Himmelsback, <i>L.A. Reader Review</i>&nbsp;"Entertaining and absorbing. . . . Information that blacks and whites have about one another is largely based upon rumors. Turner's monumental work traces the origins of rumors that have often fomented tragedies in race relations since the early encounters between Europeans and Africans."--Ishmael Reed, author of <i>Japanese by Spring</i>&nbsp;"Fascinating. . . . Turner explores the origins of rumors, how they spread and their sometimes devastating effect. . . as she examines everything from Atlanta child murders to Liz Claiborne's designer clothes, Kool and Marlboro cigarets, Reebok footwear and Troop sportswear."--Pat Holt, <i>San Francisco Chronicle</i>&nbsp;"Illuminating. . . . Although [Turner] deals primarily with some seemingly preposterous rumors circulating amont blacks in the United States, her book demonstrates how and exemplary case study of folklore can reveal the positive side of these seemingly damaging rumors. Moreover, her work opens up new perspectives on black culture."--Jack Zipes, <i>New York Times Book Review</i>&nbsp;"A necessary addition to studies of African-American culture, with insights for all races into the effects of oppression and misunderstanding."--Renee Graham, <i>Boston Globe</i>Patricia A.

While adults try to decipher Lewis Carroll's putative use of complex mathematical codes in the text, or debate his alleged use of opium, young readers simply dive with Alice through the rabbit hole, pursuing "The dream-child moving through a land / Of wonders wild and new." There they encounter the White Rabbit, the Queen of Hearts, the Mock Turtle, and the Mad Hatter, among a multitude of other characters--extinct, fantastical, and commonplace creatures. Alice journeys through this Wonderland, trying to fathom the meaning of her strange experiences. But they turn out to be "curiouser and curiouser," seemingly without moral or sense.<p> For more than 130 years, children have reveled in the delightfully <i>non</i>-moralistic, <i>non</i>-educational virtues of this classic. In fact, at every turn, Alice's new companions scoff at her traditional education. The Mock Turtle, for example, remarks that he took the "regular course" in school: Reeling, Writhing, and branches of Arithmetic-Ambition, Distraction, Uglification, and Derision. Carroll believed John Tenniel's illustrations were as important as his text. Naturally, Carroll's instincts were good; the masterful drawings are inextricably tied to the well-loved story.

As Ralph Waldo Emerson wrote to him: "I am very happy in reading [<i>Leaves of Grass</i>], as great power makes us happy ... I find incomparable things said incomparably well, as they must be."</p><p>One of the great innovative figures in American letters, Walt Whitman created a daringly new kind of poetry that became a major force in world literature. <i>Leaves Of Grass</i> is his one book. First published in 1855 with only twelve poems, it was greeted by Ralph Waldo Emerson as "the wonderful gift . . . the most extraordinary piece of wit and wisdom that America has yet contributed." Over the course of Whitman's life, the book reappeared in many versions, expanded and transformed as the author's experiences and the nation's history changed and grew. Whitman's ambition was to creates something uniquely American. In that he succeeded. His poems have been woven into the very fabric of the American character. From his solemn masterpieces "When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd" and "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking" to the joyous freedom of "Song of Myself," "I Sing the Body Electric," and "Song of the Open Road," Whitman's work lives on, an inspiration to the poets of later generations.The poetry of Walt Whitman is the cornerstone of modern American verse. He was America's first truly great poet and his influence is still evident today. The first edition of Whitman's "Leaves of Grass, published in 1855, was a revolutionary manifesto declaring America's independence from European cultural domination. His rhapsodic free verse broke radically with poetic, tradition: it was poetry about America, its democracy, its people, and its hopes. It was uniquely American without apology--brash, proud, optimistic, and filled with the bustling energy of the new and growing nation.<br>This collection brings together Whitman's greatest and most famous poems spanning the whole of his career. From the groundbreaking first edition of "Leaves of Grass are seven poems, including "Song of Myself" and "I Sing the Body Electric."<br>From later editions there are such masterpieces as "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking," and "I Hear America Singing." Also included is Whitman's great cycle of Civil War Poems, "Drum-Taps, which he wrote in the months when he was ministering to the wounded in battlefield hospitals. Concluding this collection is one of his last poems, "Good-bye My Fancy!"--his touching farewell to his muse, his life, and his readers.<br>More than one hundred years after his death, Walt Whitman's poetry has become part of the American heritage. It is a visionary which speaks as aptly to readers today as it will to future generations. As he says in "Crossing Brooklyn Ferry," "others...look back on me because I look'd forward to them." Whitman's poetry is a link that connects all Americans--past, present, and future.<br>This book features a deluxe cover, ribbon marker, top stain, and decorative endpaper with a nameplate.</p><h2>Spectacles of Death in Ancient Rome (Approaching the Ancient World)</h2><p>The elaborate and inventive slaughter of humans and animals in the arena fed an insatiable desire for violent spectacle among the Roman people.

Synge is most famous for the riots provoked by his 1907 play The Playboy of the Western World and, indeed, this was neither the first nor the last time that Synge&#39;s dramas incited passionate disagreements. But, one hundred years on, it&#39;s clear that his writings are amongst Ireland&#39;s most brilliant and significant, as well as controversial. Here, for the first time, a single volume collects all of Synge&#39;s published plays, including Playboy, along with his Poetry and Translations, and the prose works that detail his travels in The Aran Islands, In Wicklow, In Kerry and In Connemara. These are works of lasting and universal value, bringing together the sensibilities of Romanticism and Modernism, and arguing passionately for the freedom of the imagination. At the outset of the twentieth century, they not only gripped audiences with their drama, poetry and humour, they also shaped discussions about the formation of the Irish nation. Now, reading these works together in one volume reveals Synge&#39;s value system and shines a penetrating light on a key period in Irish history.

Fichte introduced the concept of recognition as a presupposition of both Rousseau's social contract and Kant's ethics. Williams shows that Hegel appropriated the concept of recognition as the general pattern of his concept of ethical life, breaking with natural law theory yet incorporating the Aristotelian view that rights and virtues are possible only within a certain kind of community.<br><br>He explores Hegel's intersubjective concept of spirit (<i>Geist</i>) as the product of affirmative mutual recognition and his conception of recognition as the right to have rights. Examining Hegel's Jena manuscripts, his <i>Philosophy of Right</i>, the <i>Phenomenology of Spirit</i>, and other works, Williams shows how the concept of recognition shapes and illumines Hegel's understandings of crime and punishment, morality, the family, the state, sovereignty, international relations, and war. A concluding chapter on the reception and reworking of the concept of recognition by contemporary thinkers including Derrida, Levinas, and Deleuze demonstrates Hegel's continuing centrality to the philosophical concerns of our age.</p><p>"This is a major contribution to Hegel scholarship. The most detailed and most useful study of recognition in the Hegel literature in any language, it will serve to orient the discussion of this concept for many years to come."--Tom Rockmore, author of <i>Cognition: An Introduction to Hegel's Phenomenology of Spirit</i><br><br>"A major contribution to Hegel studies . . .with which every serious interpreter, not merely of Hegel's 'ethics' but of Hegel's philosophy as a whole, will have to come to terms. There is no other work like this currently available in any language."--Daniel Breazeale, editor and translator of <i>Fichte: Early Philosophical Writings</i><b>Robert R.

This collection offers both historical and contemporary Marxist feminist analysis of how the reproduction of labor and life functions under capitalism, using Dalla Costa&#x2019;s insights into the vibrant and combative women&#x2019;s movement that emerged in Italy and across the world in the early 1970s. Since the first publication of <i>Women and the Subversion of the Community</i> in 1972, Dalla Costa has been a central figure in the development of autonomist thought. Her detailed research and provocative thinking deepens our understanding of the role of women&#x2019;s struggles for autonomy and control over their bodies and labor.</p><p><b>Mariarosa Dalla Costa</b> is an influential Italian Marxist feminist and activist whose works launched the &#x201c;domestic labor debate&#x201d; by redefining housework as reproductive labor necessary to the functioning of capitalism.&nbsp;<b>Camille Barbagallo </b>is a feminist activist and researcher.

In this thoughtful book, <em>Wounds Not Healed By Time</em>, Solomon Schimmel guides us through the meanings of justice, forgiveness, repentance, and reconciliation. In doing so, he probes to the core of the human encounter with evil, drawing on religious traditions, psychology, philosophy, and the personal experiences of both perpetrators and of victims.<br> Christianity, Judaism and Islam call for forgiveness and repentance in our relations with others. Yet, as Schimmel points out, there are significant differences between them as to when and whom to forgive. Is forgiving always more moral than refusing to forgive? Is it ever immoral to forgive? When is repentance a pre-condition for forgiveness, and what does repentance entail? Schimmel explores these questions in diverse contexts, ranging from conflicts in a marriage and personal slights we experience every day to enormous crimes such as the Holocaust. He applies insights on forgiveness and repentance to the Middle East, post-apartheid South Africa, inter-religious relationships, and the criminal justice system.<br> In <em>Wounds Not Healed By Time</em>, Schimmel also provides practical strategies to help us forgive and repent, preparing the way for healing and reconciliation between individuals and groups. "It is my belief," Schimmel concludes, "that the best balm for the resentment, rage, guilt, and shame engendered by human evil lies in finding the proper balance between justice, repentance, and forgiveness."</p><p><br><strong>Solomon Schimmel</strong> is Professor of Jewish Education and Psychology at Hebrew College, in Newton, Massachusetts.

This is not a sermon. It is a powerful and readable work of scholarship, imbued with the passion of a scholar who understands both evil and forgiveness and the difficult relationship between them."--Alan Dershowitz, author of <em>Shouting Fire: Civil Liberties in a Turbulent Age</em><p></p><br>"Deftly elucidates topics of revenge, justice, why and when to forgive, how to forgive, repentance, and reconciliation. He deals sensitively with these issues at the personal level and also includes institutional or national perspectives through an examination of America's race relations, the Vatican's recent apologies, Israeli-Palestinian conflicts, and the South African experience with its Truth and Reconciliation Commission.... He criticizes the pressure in our culture to forgive too quickly and provides a respectful questioning of that pressure's Christian roots. This can serve as a self-help book for sophisticated readers or as a starting point for philosophical consideration of the topic."--<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"From Jerusalem to the Vatican to Capetown, Schimmel takes us on a scholarly journey through humanity's struggle to understand and cope with evil. He argues, with both passion and insight, that our only hope for a sane future lies in overcoming our natural tendencies toward vengeance and replacing them with a balance of justice, forgiveness, and repentance. Fortunately for the human race, we can, Schimmel insists, learn to forgive. Let's hope he's right."--Robert Epstein, Ph.D., Editor-in-Chief, <em>Psychology Today</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Count of Monte Cristo (Barnes &amp; Noble Classics)</h2><p><i>The Count of Monte Cristo</i>, by <b>Alexandre Dumas</b>, is part of the <i>Barnes &amp; Noble Classics</i><i>&nbsp;</i>series, which offers quality editions at affordable prices to the student and the general reader, including new scholarship, thoughtful design, and pages of carefully crafted extras.

This change hinges around two processes: globalization and individualization. The book demonstrates that individualization is a structural characteristic of highly differentiated societies, and does not imperil social cohesion, but actually makes it possible. Ulrich Beck and Elisabeth Beck-Gernsheim argue that it is vital to distinguish between the neo-liberal idea of the free-market individual and the concept of individualization. The result is the most complete discussion of individualization currently available, showing how individualization relates to basic social rights and also paid employment; and concluding that in</p><p>Ulrich Beck is Professor of Sociology at the University of Munich.

As Thomas Morris clearly shows, racial slavery came to the English colonies as an institution without strict legal definitions or guidelines. Specifically, he demonstrates that there was no coherent body of law that dealt solely with slaves. Instead, more general legal rules concerning inheritance, mortgages, and transfers of property coexisted with laws pertaining only to slaves. According to Morris, southern lawmakers and judges struggled to reconcile a social order based on slavery with existing English common law (or, in Louisiana, with continental civil law.) Because much was left to local interpretation, laws varied between and even within states. In addition, legal doctrine often differed from local practice. And, as Morris reveals, in the decades leading up to the Civil War, tensions mounted between the legal culture of racial slavery and the competing demands of capitalism and evangelical Christianity.<br><br></p><p>"Supports and takes exception to many of the traditional views regarding Southern slavery.

As Thomas Morris clearly shows, racial slavery came to the English colonies as an institution without strict legal definitions or guidelines. Therefore, laws governing slaves and slavery had to be incorporated into the body of English common law that formed the basis of legal culture throughout the colonial South. Specifically, Morris demonstrates that there was no coherent body of law that dealt solely with slaves. Instead, more general legal rules concerning inheritance, mortgages, and transfers of property coexisted with laws pertaining only to slaves. According to Morris, southern lawmakers and judges struggled to reconcile a social order based on slavery with existing English common law (or, in Louisiana, with continental civil law). Because much was left to local interpretation, laws varied between and even within states. In addition, legal doctrine often differed from local practice. And, as Morris reveals, in the decades leading up to the Civil War, tensions mounted between the legal culture of racial slavery and the competing demands of capitalism and evangelical Christianity. Using a wide range of published and unpublished legal records from fifty countries and parishes, Morris offers a detailed and systematic analysis of cases as a means of establishing both what the doctrines concerning slavery were and how they were implemented.</p><h2>Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 3 Teacher&#39;s Manual</h2><p>Using the Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 3 Teacher&#x2019;s Manual makes it easy for teachers to help students get the most out of the hands-on, real science experiments presented in the Exploring the Building Blocks of Science Book 3 Laboratory Notebook.

"The Perfect Storm meets "A Civil Action in a gripping account of one of the most significant shipwrecks of the twentieth century. <br>In 1983 the "Marine Electric, a "reconditioned" World War II vessel, was on a routine voyage thirty miles off the East Coast of the United States when disaster struck. As the old coal carrier sank, chief mate Bob Cusick watched his crew-his friends and colleagues-succumb to the frigid forty-foot waves and subzero winds of the Atlantic. Of the thirty-four men aboard, Cusick was one of only three to survive. And he soon found himself facing the most critical decision of his life: whether to stand by the Merchant Marine officers' unspoken code of silence, or to tell the truth about why his crew and hundreds of other lives had been unnecessarily sacrificed at sea. <br>Like many other ships used by the Merchant Marine, the Marine Transport Line's "Marine Electric was very old and made of "dirty steel" (steel with excess sulfur content). Many of these vessels were in terrible condition and broke down frequently. Yet the government persistently turned a blind eye to the potential dangers, convinced that the economic return on keeping these ships was worth the risk. <br>Cusick chose to blow the whistle.<br>"<br>Until the Sea Shall Free Them re-creates in compelling detail the wreck of the "Marine Electric and the legal drama that unfolded in its wake.

Frump also brings to life Cusick's internal struggle. He knew what happened to those who spoke out against the system, knew that he too might be stripped of his license and prosecuted for "losing his ship," yet he forged ahead. In a bitter lawsuit with owners of the ship, Cusick emerged victorious. His expose of government inaction led to vital reforms in the laws regarding the safety of ships; his courageous stand places him among the unsung heroes of our time. <p>"From the Hardcover edition.</p>"This is a story told with riveting intensity.

As a contributor for more than thirty years to <i>Harper&#x2019;s</i> and other magazines, he was known for his forceful opinions. His essays were often brash and opinionated and kept him in the public limelight. One stinging essay even led the FBI to create a file on him. His five serious novels are forgotten today, but his magazine short stories and the well-paid potboilers that he wrote under a pseudonym (John August) subsidized the first of the significant works of American history that brought DeVoto lasting fame. Four of his historical works, all still in print, are <i>The Year of Decision: 1846</i>, a Book-of-the-Month Club selection in 1943; <i>Across the Wide Missouri</i>, which won the Pulitzer Prize in history in 1948; 1953 National Book Award&#x2013;winning <i>The Course of Empire</i>; and his popular abridged edition of the <i>Journals of Lewis and Clark</i>, which also appeared in 1953.<br><br> A busy man with a busy life, DeVoto found time to write and answer letters in abundance. In 1933 he received a fan letter from Katharine Sterne, a young woman hospitalized with tuberculosis; his reply touched off an extraordinary eleven-year correspondence. Sterne had graduated with honors from Wellesley College in 1928 and had served as an assistant art critic at the <i>New York Times</i> before her illness. Despite her enforced invalidism she maintained an active intellectual life. Sterne and DeVoto wrote to each other until her death in 1944, sometimes in many pages and as often as twice a week, exchanging opinions about life, literature, art, current events, family news, gossip, and their innermost feelings. DeVoto&#x2019;s biographer, Wallace Stegner, states that in these letters DeVoto &#x201c;expressed himself more intimately than in any other writings.&#x201d; Although their correspondence amounted to more than 868 letters (and is virtually complete on both sides), DeVoto and Sterne never met, both of them doubtless realizing that physical remoteness permitted a psychological proximity that was deeply nourishing.<br><br> This volume contains 140 of their letters. They have been selected by DeVoto&#x2019;s son Mark, who has also provided detailed notes clarifying ambiguities and obscure references. Readers will enjoy these letters for their wit and literary flair, but they will also gain insight into the cultural and historical crosscurrents of the 1930s and &#x2019;40s while taking an intimate and engaging look at a friendship forged entirely through words.</p><p><p>Extraordinary letters between DeVoto and a fan offer a glimpse into the literary, cultural, and historical world of the 1930s and '40s</p>Mark DeVoto, a son of Bernard and Avis DeVoto, is professor emeritus of music at Tufts University and a staff writer for the Boston Musical Intelligencer, with numerous publications in analysis of nineteenth- and twentieth-century music to his credit.</p><h2>Complete Your Dissertation or Thesis in Two Semesters or Less</h2><p>With the average length of time to complete a doctorate approaching 7.6 years, there is no better time for this comprehensive guide.

This book will help. A law professor and a leading elder law lawyer team up to offer legal and practical advice on retirement issues (finances, housing, health care), walk you through various estate planning options (living trusts, wills, advance directives), and help your family in truly sad times, disability and death in the family. They also help you avoid, and, if that's too late, deal with bad folks: caretakers who abuse elders, obnoxious bill collectors, scam artists, identity thieves, and those discriminate on the basis of age or disability. Alas, there are even legal problems associated with grandparenting and remarriage (the triumph of hope over experience). <br><br>As to driving and sex, while there is both good and bad news, one message stands out: never at the same time.<br><br>The topics may be sobering, but the style is not. It's a good read, often funny and even, on occasion, profound. Charles Sabatino, the director of the American Bar Association's Commission on Law and Aging, writes that the book is ''an encyclopedic legal reference with the down-home philosophy and wit of Will Rogers, wryly enriched by poetry, humor, and existential musings.'' Doctor Andrew Weil finds the book ''entertaining and uplifting with very practical and sensible suggestions.'' He will use it himself and will recommend it to patients, friends, and loved ones.<br><br>Whether you buy this book or not, the time is now to face the new challenges that are hurrying near. How? Sit down for an hour and write a letter to your family, covering such things as end-of-life care, living arrangements in the case of disability, and who gets the grandfather clock. (There is a suggested model in the book.) Discuss your letter with loved ones. You will save you and your family, money, confusion, and heartbreak. Challenges, unaddressed, fester.<br><br>Professor Hegland has spent his career teaching law, mostly at Arizona but also UCLA and Harvard. He has degrees from Stanford, UC Berkeley, and Harvard. Author of several legal books, he is known for his wit and clarity. Robert Fleming has spent his career practicing elder law. He lectures nationally and authors a legal treatise used by many of the nation's elder law lawyers. <br><br>They know their stuff. And now you can too.</p><p>Students taking Elder Law or Health Law might find this book helpful to get a quick introduction to topics you don't cover in your course or as a second opinion for those you do. As a savvy law professor, even if you don't teach those courses, particularily if you don't teach those courses, you get tough questions from friends and relatives &#x2014; &#x201c;Should I have a living trust? What's a health care power of attorney? What's a disgruntled heir?&#x201d; Here's help for dire times.&nbsp;Written by a law professor with the practical insights of an elder law lawyer, it covers everything from retirement (finances, housing, Medicare) to advance directives, elder abuse to nursing homes, scams, bill collectors, age discrimination, to disability in the family and hospice. It even covers sex, driving, and what it feels like growing old, having everyone start calling you &#x201c;dear&#x201d; and giving you, without even asking, those dreaded discounts. This book is a rewrite of Alive and Kicking: Legal Advice for Boomers by Kenney F. Hegland and Robert B. Fleming.Professor Kenney Hegland has spent his career teaching law students how to use the law to solve problems. In addition to teaching at the University of Arizona, he has taught at UCLA, Harvard, and the University of San Diego's London Program. He graduated from Stanford, attended law school at UC Berkeley, and has an advanced law degree from Harvard. Early in his career he worked with the legendary Civil Rights lawyer, C.B. King (in Albany, Georgia) and with Cesar Chavez and the United Farm Workers Union (in Delano, California). Two of his books, Introduction to the Study and Practice of Law and Trial and Clinical Skills, are widely used in the nation's law schools. Committed to helping the public understand the law, he has written and produced eight videos about law for high school students. These films are currently distributed by the Discovery Channel. <br><br>Attorney Robert Fleming has spent decades practicing elder law in Tucson, Arizona and has become one of the nation's leaders in that field. His particular emphasis is on planning for individuals with disabilities and other special needs. His professional background includes serving as the Public Fiduciary in Tucson and as Tucson City Magistrate. In addition to maintaining an active law practice, he writes and lectures extensively on elder law issues. His book, The Elder Law Answer Book, is one of the principal treatises on elder law used by lawyers. He maintains his law firm's website as a ten-year labor of love. In his spare time he is a martial artist, pilot, and scuba diver.</p><h2>Art, commerce and colonialism 1600&#x2013;1800 (Art and its Global Histories, 2)</h2><p><i>Art, Commerce and Colonialism 1600-1800</i> examines European art, architecture and design of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the light of the continent&#x2019;s growing engagement with the rest of the world. In a series of case studies spanning the globe from Asia to the Americas, it shows how the expansion of intercontinental trade and the proliferation of colonial ventures gave rise to new and diverse forms of visual and material culture. Among the examples discussed are ornate altarpieces in the cathedrals of colonial Latin America, Dutch still-life paintings of exotic luxury imports, English interior decoration in the Chinoiserie style and the architecture of plantation houses in North America and the Caribbean. Drawing on a wide range of recent scholarship, the book proposes a new history of European art 1600-1800, which should appeal to undergraduate students as well as to a general readership.</p><p>Emma Barker is Senior Lecturer in Art History at The Open University<i>'Art, Commerce and Colonialism</i> is a marvellous and much-needed volume. It brilliantly represents the cutting edge of scholarship on the politics and the commerce of art in the early modern era, while making central issues and a fascinating array of objects readily accessible. This book is poised to shape the next generation of teaching early modern global art history, and offers a valuable road map for further study.' Claudia Swan, Associate Professor of Art History, Northwestern University &#x2018;<i>Art, Commerce and Colonialism</i> masterfully shows how the interaction between Western Europe and the rest of world came to reshape the continent&#x2019;s art and visual culture in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries. In this book trade, power and art are part of one global process.&#x2019; Giorgio Riello, Professor of Global History and Culture, University of Warwick</p><h2>Emile: Or Treatise on Education (Great Books in Philosophy)</h2><p>In his pioneering treatise on education the great French philosopher presented concepts that had a significant influence on the development of pedagogy, and yet many of his ideas still sound radical today. Written in reaction to the stultifying system of rote learning and memorization prevalent throughout Europe in Rousseau&#39;s time, Emile is a utopian vision of child-centered education, full of the sentiments of Romanticism, which Rousseau himself inspired.Imagining a typical boy named Emile, Rousseau creates an ideal model of one-on-one tutelage from infancy to manhood with himself as the child&#39;s mentor. &#34;Everything is good as it comes from the hands of the Author of Nature; but everything degenerates in the hands of man.&#34; This is the first of many provocative statements that characterize this work and are a hallmark of Rousseau&#39;s arresting rhetoric. As in so many of his other famous works, here too Rousseau asserts his main thesis that human beings by nature are good; it is only the distorting influences of civilization that have corrupted them.If this is true, then in educating children one must do nothing to interfere with human nature in its natural course. Far from being the chief means by which society inculcates its rules and principles, education should be the method of helping youths discover the inherent truths of their own human nature. From infancy to young adulthood learning should come purely from personal experience. Rather than imparting facts, teachers should foster self-discovery, so that knowledge is acquired through following innate curiosity, not vicariously through the statements of others.Educators as well as students of philosophy will find much to admire in Rousseau&#39;s original and still radical ideas.</p><p><b>JEAN-JACQUES ROUSSEAU </b>was born in Geneva on June 28, 1712, and raised by his father after his mother died giving him life. The reproachment Rousseau experienced at his father's hand produced feelings of guilt and inferiority that were to haunt him throughout his life. During his youth, Rousseau wandered throughout Europe from job to job. Having moved to Paris from the city of Lyon in 1742, Rousseau sought the intellectual life and soon became associated with Denis Diderot and the <i>philosophes.<br></i><br> Rousseau's literary career began with his entry in an essay contest in 1749 on the subject of the relationship of science and the arts to morals. His winning essay, <i>Discourses on Sciences and the Arts, </i>soon became the foundation for his later work entitled the <i>Discourse on the Origin of Inequality </i>(1753). With its publication, he became a figure of some controversy in France. Ideological differences between his views and those of his Enlightenment contemporaries soon surfaced, and Rousseau once again found himself alienated from the intellectual establishment.<br><br> His differences with the <i>philosophes </i>proved to be the impetus for Rousseau's future work on the content of human nature and man's rela�tionship to society and the state. Contrary to the individualism and intel�lectual enlightenment advocated by his contemporaries, Rousseau sought to sublimate individuality in the security of the collective per�sonality known as the general will. This new society would be typified by concern for the community and would be ruled by laws developed through a plan of controlled participation. Rousseau's social theory was developed in his work <i>Julie, ou la Nouvelle Heloise </i>(1761) and in <i>Emile </i>(1762). The institutional structure was constructed in <i>The Social Con�tract </i>(1761).<br><br> In <i>Emile, </i>Rousseau presents his utopian vision of child-centered education, full of the sentiments of Romanticism, a movement that Rousseau inspired.<br><br> Rousseau's later years were spent fighting off persecution, both real and imaginary. He died near Paris on July 2, 1778.</p><h2>Read, Wonder, Listen: Stories from the Bible for Young Readers</h2><p>"Every person who tells these stories does it in a slightly different way. And every person who reads these stories hears something a bit different. So even though these stories are very old, they are also always new." Laura Alary combines her gift for telling the biblical stories, with historical research, contemporary concerns about language, and a compassionate and inclusive theology making Read, Wonder, Listen, a perfect children's Bible for progressive Christians. Read, Wonder, Listen will help children, and the adults who love them, ask the big questions of life - the same questions asked by the people in the Bible: Who are we? Where do we belong? What are we supposed to do and who are we supposed to be? Where is God? How does God want us to live? "The reason these stories have lasted so long," writes Alary, "the reason they were collected and saved so carefully, is because people have always found in them something precious. Something that speaks to people of all times and places. All of these stories are about the great Mystery we call God. They tell of people who met God, wondered about God, waited for God, and were surprised by God." That sense of wonder and surprise is strikingly and evocatively captured in the full-colour illustrations by Ann Sheng. <br><br></p><p>Many years have passed since Laura used to make her own books with Manila paper, mucilage, and crayons. Nowadays her books look much more professional, but the process of creating them is as much fun as it always was! In her writing, Laura draws upon her background in Classics, theology and biblical studies, as well as her long-standing interest in ancient history, folklore, mythology, and science. Her books are meant to teach and to entertain, but most of all, to encourage children to wonder about the world and to ask really big questions.Laura's books include: Is That Story True? (CopperHouse, 2010); Jesse's Surprise Gift (CopperHouse, 2012); Mira and the Big Story (Skinner House, 2012); Victor's Pink Pyjamas (CopperHouse, 2013); How Do I Pray for Grandpa? (CopperHouse, 2014); Make Room: A Child's Guide to Lent and Easter (Paraclete Press, 2016).<br><br>Ann Sheng is a tireless learner who aspires to become a doctor, scientist and world traveller.

Laura Alary moves amongst the spaces, the gaps between the words, what is not written in the sacred texts, and weaves historical research, scholarly interpretation, and progressive theology into the fabric of life of a people of God, and we find our stories in the stories of long ago. Along the way, we encounter the mystery we call God.

It was a noisy, hot, scary place. Choking gas exploded from volcanoes and oceans of lava bubbled around the globe... Then in the deep, dark ocean, something amazing happened. This is an exciting and dramatic story about how life began and developed on Planet Earth, written especially for younger children.</p><p>The authors explain how the first living cell was created, and how the cells multiply and create jellyfish and worms, and then fish with bendy necks, which drag themselves out of the water into swampy forests. They tell the story of the biggest creatures that have ever walked on land - the dinosaurs. Long after that, hairy creatures who have babies, not eggs, take over, stand on two legs and spread around the world, some of them living through cataclysmic events such as ice ages and volcanic eruptions. Everyone living today is related to these survivors. With delightful illustrations including lots of detail and humour, all carefully researched and checked, this book shows the development of life on Earth in a truly accessible and simple way.</p></p><p><p><b>Catherine Barr</b> studied Ecology at Leeds University and trained as a journalist.

The seventh edition continues to examine such aspects of organizational behavior as organizational culture, leadership, motivation, change, conflict and decision-making while maintaining high standards of scholarship and a lucid, readily accessible writing style. <b> </b> For anyone interested in organizational behavior particular to the arena of education.</p><p></p><h2>The Practice of English Language Teaching, New Edition (Longman Handbooks for Language Teachers)</h2><p>In this new edition there is a new chapter on teaching vocabulary, a section on discovery techniques, more on task-based learning and learner training, and a recognition of the change of perception about what communicative competence might be. Many of the categories of communicative activities have been rearranged and there is a more detailed account of teacher roles, together with a section on the use of the mother tongue. The sample lesson plan has been changed and the many examples from textbooks generally reflect the materials now in use rather than those which were current when the first edition came out. The structure of &#34;The Practice of English Language Teaching&#34; remains essentially the same. In part A; Background, the author looks at some of the theoretical concerns which influence the teaching of English as a foreign language. In part B, Practice, the author looks at study materials and techniques for teaching, and in part C, Management and Planning, he looks at how classrooms and students can be organized and what is the best way to prepare for a lesson. The appendix on materials evaluation should help anyone who is in a position to select the textbook which the students are going to use. &#34;The Practice of Language Teaching&#34; deals specifically with the teaching of English as a foreign language (EFL). It is not focused especially on English as a second language (ESL) although much of the context of the book can be applied to that slightly different teaching situation.

Set in New Orleans and the Southern Louisiana coast at the end of the nineteenth century, the plot centers on Edna Pontellier and her struggle to reconcile her increasingly unorthodox views on femininity and motherhood with the prevailing social attitudes of the turn-of-the-century American South. It is one of the earliest American novels that focuses on women&#39;s issues without condescension. It is also widely seen as a landmark work of early feminism, generating mixed reaction from contemporary readers and criticism.The novel&#39;s blend of realistic narrative, incisive social commentary, and psychological complexity makes The Awakening a precursor of American modernist literature; it prefigures the works of American novelists such as William Faulkner and Ernest Hemingway and echoes the works of contemporaries such as Edith Wharton and Henry James. It can also be considered among the first Southern works in a tradition that would culminate with the modern masterpieces of Faulkner, Flannery O&#39;Connor, Eudora Welty, Katherine Anne Porter, and Tennessee Williams.</p><p><p><b>Kate Chopin's classic, an American <i>Anna Karenina</i></b><b><i>, </i>joins Canongate's Canons series. </b></p><p><b>With an introduction </b><b>by Barbara Kingsolver</b></p>Edna Pontellier is a young woman living comfortably in the beautiful city of New Orleans. She is fond of her husband and proud of her sons but finds it impossible to accept that &#x201c;for women it is a holy privilege to efface themselves as individuals.&#x201d; She fights back in the only way she knows, and her solution is extreme. Infamous in its time, <b>The Awakening</b> is now recognized as a radical work of fiction&#x2014;sensuous, arresting, and clear&#x2013;eyed in its commitment to freedom and independence.

(Frederick Fyvie)Bruce was born in October the 12th, 1910, in Elgin (Scotland), to a Brethren Assemblies family. His father was an itinerant preacher for the Assemblies. F.F. was baptized and accepted as a member of his local congregation in September 1928. He remained loyal to his denomination for the rest of his life. &#x201c;Through my own experience with the Brethren, I can say they are the ideal place where a lay theologian can serve the Church with his gifts&#x201d; (Restrospect, p. 285).</p> <p>As a lover of the Biblie and of the classical languages, when he was only 10 years old, he started simultaneous studies in Greek and Latin. F.F. was admitted to Aberdeen University in October 1928. He studied also in University of Cambridge (England, 1932-34) and in the University of Vienna (Austria, 1934-35), studying in preparation for his Graduation and Doctoral degree, excelling in both.</p> <p>Bruce taught Greek in the Universities of Edinburgh (1935-38) and Leeds (1938-47). Afterwards, he taught Bible History and Literature in the University of Sheffield (1947-59) followed by Bible Criticism and Exegesis in the University of Manchester (1959-78).</p> <p>He lectured in prestigious universities all around the world: Marburg (Germany), Amsterdam (The Netherlands), Auckland (New Zealand), and Makerere (Uganda).

K. Pradeep </p><table> <tbody> <tr> <td></td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <p></p> <p>Your brain -- and your customers&#x2019; &#x2013; is 100,000 years old. Its basic skills and functions are the same ones it developed to survive on the plains of Africa so many millennia ago. As such, the &#x201c;modern&#x201d; brain is occasionally at odds with 21st century life.</p> <p>As it navigates through that life, your brain is like an iceberg. Most of its decisions occur below the water line. Your conscious mind contributes to making only about 5% of your decisions. The subconscious mind makes the other 95%.</p> <p>For most of our evolution, gathering food and fuel have been primary objectives. That&#x2019;s partly why shopping is, at its heart, a primal activity. Here are some examples of how the subconscious mind functions when shopping.</p> <p><strong> 1) Your brain gets scared in some stores.</strong> Your conscious mind doesn&#x2019;t know it, of course, but your subconscious mind views sharp corners as a threat. Every time you push a shopping cart around the end of an aisle, your subconscious mind winces. The cringe dates back to the earliest days of the modern brain, when humans still roamed the Serenghetti. Think about it: you don&#x2019;t see many sharp angles in nature. When your subconscious mind comes across straight lines and sharp angles, it&#x2019;s hard-wired to perceive them as a threat and prompts you to avoid them. Smart retailers will learn to curve and soften their sharp corners better to invite the buying brain in.</p> <p><strong> 2) Too much of one thing can make your brain go blind. </strong>&#x201c;Repetition blindness&#x201d; sets in when we see too many of the same objects. Think about a wall of toothpaste boxes, all approximately the same size and many sharing similar colors and graphics. Confronted with this much &#x201c;sameness,&#x201d; your brain looks for differences. When it can&#x2019;t find enough variations, it blends everything together, becoming &#x201c;blind&#x201d; to the individual packages themselves. This is why we sometimes can&#x2019;t see the trees for the forest. In a sea of sameness, smart manufacturers will find a way for their packaging to &#x201c;pop&#x201d; at the shelf.</p> <p><strong> 3) Men and women are hard-wired to shop differently.</strong> Men shop by looking for targets; women shop by looking for landmarks. Women explore their territory; men make maps.</p> <p><strong> 4) Origin is important. </strong>The brain likes to see the source of the product inside the package. It appreciates cows on milk cartons, for instance, and grapes on bottles of wine.</p> <p><strong> 5) Faces and eye contact fascinate the brain.</strong> The brain needs to see faces to determine intent. Are you friend or foe? But the brain also prefers ambiguous expressions on faces. It likes to figure out the puzzle. What is s/he thinking or feeling? The Mona Lisa is a perfect example of the power of ambiguity. Closer to home, ambiguous faces on packaging and promotions are like magnets to the shopping brain.</p> <p></p><b>Praise for <i>The Buying Brain</i></b> <p>?Dr. Pradeep makes the case for the potential of the dynamic new field of neuromarketing as a multifaceted marketing tool, and he does so with the combination of passion, intellect, and insight for which he is renowned.

Hoffman quotes living mathematicians extensively, giving the reader a feel for the nature of the mathematical community and insight into how this community attempts to resolve open questions. This book is low in mathematical rigor, making it suitable for any interested reader.YA-- This collection of highly readable essays on a variety of mathematical puzzles will both appeal to YAs and expand their understanding of the topics with which mathematicians grapple. Hoffman explains how to construct an unbreakable code, how to build an Easter egg, what a Mobius strip is, and how that relates to molecular structure. He discusses a puzzle which has remained unsolved since Archimedes' time, and explains why some problems are truly insoluble, even by computers. He discusses the origins and limits of computers, and the relationship between mathematical statistics and politics. The book can be read in total, or at random.

Adopting a radically new point of view, Ronna Burger deciphers some of the most perplexing conundrums of this influential treatise by approaching it as Aristotle&#x2019;s dialogue with the Platonic Socrates.</p> <p>Tracing the argument of the <i>Ethics</i> as it emerges through that approach, Burger&#x2019;s careful reading shows how Aristotle represents ethical virtue from the perspective of those devoted to it while standing back to examine its assumptions and implications. </p> <p>&#x201c;This is the best book I have read on Aristotle&#x2019;s <i>Nicomachean Ethics</i>. It is so well crafted that reading it is like reading the <i>Ethics</i> itself, in that it provides an education in ethical matters that does justice to all sides of the issues.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mary P. Nichols, Baylor University</p> <p></p> <p></p></p><p><b>Ronna Burger</b> is professor of philosophy at Tulane University.&#x201c;This is the best book I have read on Aristotle&#x2019;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>. It is so well crafted that reading it is like reading the <em>Ethics</em> itself, in that it provides an education in ethical matters that does justice to all sides of the issues.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mary P. Nichols, Baylor University (Mary P. Nichols, Baylor University )<br><br> &#x201c;Ronna Burger&#x2019;s <em>Aristotle&#x2019;s Dialogue with Socrates</em> brilliantly interprets the <em>Nicomachean Ethics </em>as a response to the strong forms of Socratic intellectualism. Her scholarly and reconstructive interpretation sets the stage for an exploration of the complex relations between the moral and intellectual virtues, one that has implications for Aristotle&#x2019;s views on the role of philosophical inquiry in civic life.&#x201d;&#x2014;Amelie Rorty, Harvard University (Amelie Rorty, Harvard University )<br><br> &#x201c;This is a work of distinction that will be indispensable for all serious students of Aristotle&#x2019;s ethics. It requires and will repay a close reading of the Aristotelian texts. Burger&#x2019;s book exhibits the lucidity that is appropriate to complex philosophical argument. In this sense, her study mirrors Aristotle&#x2019;s own way of writing on the human predicament.&#x201d;&#x2014;Stanley Rosen, Boston University (Stanley Rosen, Boston University )<br><br> "The reader will be filled with a genuine sense of anticipation as this work moves to its culminating conclusion. Moreover&#x2014;and this is an aspect of the work that deserves special praise&#x2014;the entire monograph is brimming with interesting observations about the connections between passages in the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> and specific exchanges within various Platonic dialogues. Burger is an author who has a tremendous number of ideas about a wide variety of passages in both authors, and I think scholars of Plato will find this work just as insightful as those who focus upon Aristotle." (Steven Skultety <em>Notre Dame Philosophical Reviews</em> )<br><br> "In her dialectical reflection on Aristotle&#x2019;s reflection on thinking as a species of action, Ronna Burger discovers the saving grace of our incompleteness&#x2014;what she calls in her Acknowledgments &#x2018;the unintended consequences of unwished for circumstances&#x2019;. By tracing the salutary consequences of the unwished for, she has brought to fruition a remarkable interpretation of Aristotle&#x2019;s <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em>, for she has not forced a Platonic reading on Aristotle but has rather uncovered, in the ground of their friendship, the deep sameness that is revealed in their apparent difference, the dialogic nature of the rational activity of soul." (Michael Davis <em>Polis</em> )<br><br> "This remarkable and wonderful book on Aristotle''s Nicomachean Ethics exhibits a profound understanding of both the contents and complex intention of that amazing work. This interpretation cannot be ignored by anyone who intends to write on the Ethics in the foreseeable future. The reviewer cannot do justice to Professor Burger''s detailed and subtle analysis of almost every chapter of the Ethics in this brief account of her book, but hopefully enough is intimated to lead those who are interested in Aristotle, the problem of Socrates, ancient philosophy, and the nature of ethical virtue to read this magisterial study."&#x2014;Donald C. Lindenmuth, <em>Review of Metaphysics</em> (Donald C. Lindenmuth <em>Review of Metaphysics</em> )<br><br> "On the whole I found Burger''s volume to be one of the most philosophically thought-provoking contemporary treatments of the <em>Ethics</em>. . . . The volume has been in the works for over a decade and it is clearly the mature reflection of a scholar equally conversant in philosophy and classics."&#x2014;Thornton C. Lockwood, <em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em> (Thornton C. Lockwood <em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em> )<br><br> "[Burger] invites her readers to reflect on the deepest ethical and theoretical questions. . . . Her impressive work is clearly the fruit of much solitary labor as well as friendly conversation, and it demonstrates Burger''s grasp not only of Aristotle''s thought but of the many Platonic dialogues she places in conversation with it."&#x2014;Susan D. Collins, <em>Claremont Review of Books</em> (Susan D. Collins <em>Claremont Review of Books</em> )<br><br> "A remarkable dialectical journey through the Nicomachean Ethics, placing us on the inside track of thinking through the mind of Aristotle." (Monica Prabhakar <em>Philosophy in Review</em> )<br><br> "A treatment of the <em>Ethics</em> that is both thoughtful and thought-provoking, one that requires, and rewards, careful rereading." (Kevin M. Cherry <em>Review of Politics</em> )<br><br> "In <em>Aristotle&#x2019;s Dialogue with Socrates</em>, Ronna Burger invites the reader to examine the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> with a fresh eye, and to consider that it is perhaps not the treatise that it appears to be but rather the dialogue that Plato never wrote: a dialogue between two philosophers.. . . As she discovers and discloses the evidence in the text for Aristotle&#x2019;s dialogue with Socrates, she herself practices and illustrates how we, the readers, may enter into and engage in a philosophic dialogue with Aristotle."&#x2014;Evanthia Speliotis, <em>Interpretation<br><br></em>"<em>Aristotle&#x2019;s Dialogue with Socrates</em> seems above all to aim to provoke its reader to do the hard work of studying the <em>Nicomachean Ethics</em> as carefully as possible, and as a whole. Doing so, [Burger] believes&#x2014;and believes rightly&#x2014;will actually help such a reader become someone &#x2018;who thinks out everything for himself.&#x2019; Judged by this standard, her book is an extraordinary achievement."&#x2014;David Roochnik, <em>Epoche<br></em><br>&#x201c;Burger has written a book brimming with stimulating puzzles and insights covering, almost in the style of a commentary, every part of the <em>Ethics</em>. . . . Her book&#x2019;s ability to inspire and foster inquiry into the subject matter of the <em>Ethics </em>is quite possibly the most beneficial result her mode of interpretation yields.&#x201d;&#x2014;Larry Bloom, <em>Journal of the History of Philosoph</em>y</p><h2>Construction Technology Trainee Guide, Hardcover</h2><p><p>This curriculum is ideal for programs formatted as Construction Cluster or Building Trades.

In turn, Ahasverus was cursed to roam the earth until the Second Coming. Stefan Heym's novel re-creates and expands this myth to propose that the right synthesis of love and rebellion can bring humankind to the Kingdom of Heaven.<br><br>Heym introduces both Ahasverus and Lucifer as angels cast out of heaven for their opinions on God's order. Their respective oppositions continue throughout the rest of time: Ahasverus remains defiant through protest rooted in love and a faith in progress, while Lucifer is rebellious by means of his old, familiar methods. In a funny eternity of run-ins, debates, and meddling with characters such as Christ, a disciple of Luther, and a Marxist professor in East Germany, Ahasverus and Lucifer struggle on, awaiting the Second Coming.<br></p><p>Stefan Heym is representative of many intellectuals in the former East Germany who found themselves torn between loyalty to the ideals of their state and disdain for the reality. He was born into a secular Jewish family in Chemnitz. As a young man, he went to the United States to escape Hitler, where he worked for a while as a journalist. In 1943 he joined the American army. His first novel, <i>The Crusaders</i> (1948), became a best-seller. It was loosely based on his wartime experiences and filled with contempt not only for the Nazi government, but for virtually all of German culture. Distressed by the rise of McCarthyism in the United States and by Western tolerance of former Nazi officials, Heym emigrated to East Germany in 1953 and gave his enthusiastic support to the Socialist aspirations of his new homeland. His disillusionment with East Germany was far more gradual and, by his own account, more difficult than that experienced in the United States. In 1976 Heym protested the forced emigration of singer-songwriter Wolf Biermann from the German Democratic Republic. Two years later he was fined and expelled from the East German Writers' Union for accepting royalties for work published abroad. Though Heym continued to believe that the GDR was the "better-half" of Germany, disillusion with the reality of socialism moved him to turn to his Jewish heritage for inspiration in novels such as <i>The King David Report</i> (1972) and<i> The Wandering Jew</i> (1984). In 1992 he became a founding member of the "Committee for Justice," a lobby representing the interests of former East Germans in a newly united Germany.Text: English, German (translation)</p><h2>Essentials of Biology</h2><p><i><b>Essentials of Biology</b></i> is an introductory biology text for non-major students that can be used in a one- or two-semester course.

He has dissected the various aspects of the gun violence epidemic in the United States into its component parts and considered them separately. He has produced a scientifically based analysis of the data and indeed the microdata of the over 30,000 deaths and 75,000 injuries which occur each year. Consideration and adoption of the policy lessons he recommends would strengthen the Constitutional protections that all of our citizens have to life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."<br>-Richard F. Corlin, Past President, American Medical Association<br><br>"This lucid and penetrating study is essential reading for anyone who wishes to understand the tragedy of gun violence in America and-even more important-what we can do to stop it. David Hemenway cuts through the cant and rhetoric in a way that no fair-minded person can dismiss, and no sane society can afford to ignore."<br>-Richard North Patterson, novelist<br><br>"The rate of gun-related homicide, suicide, and accidental injury has reached epidemic proportions in American society. Diagnosing and treating the gun violence epidemic demands the development of public health solutions in conjunction with legislative and law enforcement strategies."<br>-Kweisi Mfume, President and CEO of NAACP<br><br>"In scholarly, sober analytic assessments, including rigorous critiques of NRA-popularized pseudoscience, David Hemenway constructs a convincing case that firearm availability is a critical and proximal cause of unparalleled carnage. By formulating such violence as a public health issue, he proposes workable policies analogous to ones that reduced injuries from tobacco, alcohol, and automobiles."<br>-Jerome P. Kassirer, Editor-in-Chief Emeritus, New England Journal of Medicine, and Distinguished Professor, Tufts University School of Medicine<br><br>"As a former District Attorney and Attorney General, I know the urgency of providing safe homes, schools and neighborhoods for all. This remarkable tour-de-force is a powerful study of one promising solution: a data-rich, eminently readable demonstration of why we should treat gun violence as an American epidemic."<br>-Scott Harshbarger, Former Attorney General of Massachusetts, President and CEO of Common Cause<br>On an average day in the United States, guns are used to kill almost eighty people, and to wound nearly three hundred more. If any other consumer product had this sort of disastrous effect, the public outcry would be deafening; yet when it comes to guns such facts are accepted as a natural consequence of supposedly high American rates of violence.<br><br><i>Private Guns, Public Health</i> explodes that myth and many more, revealing the advantages of treating gun violence as a consumer safety and public health problem. David Hemenway fair-mindedly and authoritatively demonstrates how a public-health approach-which emphasizes prevention over punishment, and which has been so successful in reducing the rates of injury and death from infectious disease, car accidents, and tobacco consumption-can be applied to gun violence.<br><br>Hemenway uncovers the complex connections between guns and self-defense, gun violence and schools, gun prevalence and homicide, and more. Finally, he outlines a policy course that would significantly reduce gun-related injury and death.<br><br>With its bold new public-health approach to guns, <i>Private Guns, Public Health</i> marks a shift in our understanding of guns that will-finally-point us toward a solution.<br></p><p>David Hemenway is Professor of Health Policy at the Harvard School of Public Health, and Director of Harvard&#39;s Injury Control Research Center and Youth Violence Prevention Center. A former Pew Fellow on Injury Control, he has been a Senior Soros Justice Fellow and held a Robert Wood Johnson Investigator Award in Health Policy Research.The public health community began researching gun violence about two decades ago, a late entrant in a field traditionally occupied by criminologists. David Hemenway, an economist at the Harvard School of Public Health and the director of the Injury Control Research Center there, has been a leader in this effort. His book is the first to synthesize the findings in this new field and to reference other literature as well. The book provides an account of the nature of the problem of gun violence and views about what can be done to mitigate it, engaging all the principal controversies. Scholars will appreciate the author's logical caution in drawing inferences from the evidence, as well as the methodologic appendix and superb bibliography. Yet the book is highly readable and will serve advocates and other interested citizens as an accessible, comprehensive briefing on the relevant statistics and arguments. (Figure) Hemenway develops the public health approach as a pragmatic, science-based effort to reduce injuries and deaths from gun violence. The goal is not to assign blame but, rather, to find solutions, with an emphasis on prevention. The canonical example for injury-control investigators is highway safety, in which the comprehensive approach propounded by Bill Haddon, a physician who served as the first director of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, continues to provide the conceptual framework. Haddon sought to direct the focus in highway safety away from improved driving and toward improved design of vehicles and roadways. For gun violence, the analogy is to focus less on the shooters and more on access to guns and their design. Of course, it is not obvious that an approach that has been successful in reducing highway crashes, which are mostly unintentional, will also be successful in curtailing the intentional acts (suicide and assault) that produce most gun injuries and deaths. If shooters were determined, resourceful people with clear and sustained deadly intent, then regulating guns would likely have little effect on the number of homicides and suicides; they would find a way. But in the real world, as Hemenway spells out, a large portion of serious intentional violence would be less deadly if guns were less readily available or less user-friendly. Furthermore, although gun "accidents" make up only a small fraction of the total gun injuries, they are common enough that the Consumer Product Safety Commission would surely give them high priority if it were not barred from doing so by federal law. Another feature separates firearms from vehicles: the possibility of "virtuous use." The belief in the importance of giving civilians a means of self-defense has long been used as an argument for preserving the right to keep handguns in the home. In recent decades, that philosophy has fueled a successful effort to ease state restrictions on carrying concealed weapons in public. This campaign has made great use of the work of criminologist Gary Kleck, who concluded from his analysis of survey data that there are millions of virtuous self-defense uses of guns each year. Hemenway has done more than any other scholar in rebutting that absurd claim. The book includes a summary of his results, which are so definitive as to settle the issue for any open-minded observer. When it comes time to assess the evidence on the effectiveness of particular interventions to reduce gun violence, Hemenway is restrained. He notes, "Unfortunately, there exist few convincing evaluations of past firearms laws." In reviewing the evidence on what works and what might work, he tends to believe that studies support the feasibility of reducing accidents and suicides more than they do the likelihood of cutting down on gun assaults. Here again, he summons a public health core principle: that good data are the precondition for progress. Indeed, he and his center get much of the credit for designing a practical system that is now in the pilot stage in a number of states, with funding from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The public health approach rests on the optimistic belief that good science will engender good policy and practice. Optimism is a scarce commodity in the area of gun policy. Private Guns, Public Health supplies reason to hope. <i>Philip J. Cook, Ph.D.</i><br>Copyright � 2004 Massachusetts Medical Society. All rights reserved.

In addition to thoroughly researching primary source materials and to critiquing individual art works with sensitivity and erudition, the author has conducted numerous interviews with Catlett and has analyzed with clarity the political context of her work and her diverse sympathies and allegiances. Herzog examines key artistic influences and shows how Catlett transformed an extraordinary stylistic vocabulary into a socially charged statement.<br>In tracing Catlett's long and continuing career as a graphic artist and sculptor in Mexico, Herzog explores an important period in Catlett's life between the 1950s and the 1970s about which almost nothing is known in the United States. She examines the "Mexicanness" in Catlett's work in its fluent relationship to the underlying and constant sense of African American identity she brought with her to Mexico. Herzog's solidly grounded interpretation offers a new way to understand Catlett's work and reveals this artist as a fascinating and pivotal intercultural figure whose powerful art manifests her firm belief that the visual arts can play a role in the construction of a meaningful identity, both transnational and ethnically grounded.</p><p><p>A new paperback edition of the primary work on the African America sculptor and graphic artist.</p>Melanie Anne Herzog is associate professor of art history at Edgewood College in Madison, Wisconsin.</p><h2>CSB Apologetics Study Bible for Students, Blue Hardcover, Black Letter, Defend Your Faith, Study Notes and Commentary, Articles, Profiles, Full-Color Maps, Easy-to-Read Bible Serif Type</h2><p><p>Now updated with even more material, the <i>CSB Apologetics Study Bible for Students</i> anchors young Christians in the truths of Scripture and equips them with thoughtful responses when the core issues of their faith are challenged.

To understand that strangeness, Bryan Jay Wolf turns to the history of early modernism and to ways of seeing that first developed in the seventeenth century.

Instead Vermeer complicated Dutch domestic art and invented what has puzzled and captivated his admirers ever since: the odd daubs of white pigment, scattered across the plane of the canvas; patches of blurred surface, contradicting the painting's illusionism without explanation; and the querulous silence that endows his women with secrets they dare not reveal.<br><br>This beautifully illustrated book situates Vermeer in relation to his predecessors and contemporaries, and it demonstrates how powerfully he wrestled with questions of gender, class, and representation.

Is it possible that history "overly remembers" some events at the expense of others? A landmark work in philosophy, Paul Ricoeur's <i>Memory, History, Forgetting</i> examines this reciprocal relationship between remembering and forgetting, showing how it affects both the perception of historical experience and the production of historical narrative.<br><br><i>Memory, History, Forgetting</i>, like its title, is divided into three major sections. Ricoeur first takes a phenomenological approach to memory and mnemonical devices. The underlying question here is how a memory of present can be of something absent, the past. The second section addresses recent work by historians by reopening the question of the nature and truth of historical knowledge. Ricoeur explores whether historians, who can write a history of memory, can truly break with all dependence on memory, including memories that resist representation. The third and final section is a profound meditation on the necessity of forgetting as a condition for the possibility of remembering, and whether there can be something like happy forgetting in parallel to happy memory. Throughout the book there are careful and close readings of the texts of Aristotle and Plato, of Descartes and Kant, and of Halbwachs and Pierre Nora.<br><br>A momentous achievement in the career of one of the most significant philosophers of our age, <i>Memory, History, Forgetting</i> provides the crucial link between Ricoeur's <i>Time and Narrative</i> and <i>Oneself as Another</i> and his recent reflections on ethics and the problems of responsibility and representation. <br><br>&#x201c;His success in revealing the internal relations between recalling and forgetting, and how this dynamic becomes problematic in light of events once present but now past, will inspire academic dialogue and response but also holds great appeal to educated general readers in search of both method for and insight from considering the ethical ramifications of modern events. . . .

Ricoeur's style here is both leisurely and comprehensive, opening up each new avenue of theory by explaining which philosophic tenets and texts inform his narrative. His success in revealing the internal relations between recalling and forgetting, and how this dynamic becomes problematic in light of events once present but now past, will inspire academic dialogue and response but also holds great appeal to educated general readers in search of both method for and insight from considering the ethical ramifications of modern events.

(Luisa Passerini <i>The Times Higher Education Supplmenet</i> 2005-10-21)</p><h2>The Hurried Child: Growing Up Too Fast Too Soon (Revised edition)</h2><p>Often with the very best intentions, Americans expose their children to overwhelming pressures, pressures that can lead to low self-esteem, to teenage pregnancy, and even to teenage suicide. By blurring the boundaries of what is age appropriate, by expecting or imposing too much too soon, we force our kids to grow up too fast, to mimic adult sophistication while secretly yearning for innocence.With the first edition of The Hurried Child, David Elkind emerges as the voice of reason, calling our attention to the crippling effects of hurrying. But in the decade since this book first appeared, a new generation of parents has inadvertently stepped up the assault on childhood, misled by the new and comforting rhetoric of childhood &#x201d;competence.&#x201d;Now Dr. Elkind has thoroughly revised this enormously successful book to debunk the notion of &#x201d;competence&#x201d; tha thas children racing off to early enrichment programs, burdened by the pressure to &#x201d;achieve,&#x201d; and coming home alone to an empty house after school. He sees &#x201d;sompetence&#x201d; as a notion meant to rationalize the needs of adults, not to serve the genuine needs of kids, a notion that has fourth graders dieting to fit into designer jeans and children of divorce asked to be the confidants of their troubled parents.In updating this new edition, Dr. Elkind takes a detailed and up-to-the-minute look at the world of today's kids in terms of education, movies, television, rock &amp; roll, and social trends, to see where the hyrrying occurs and why. And as before, he offers parents and teachers insight, advice, and hope for encouraging healthy development while protecting the joy and feedom of childhood.</p><p>David Elkind is Professor of Child Development in the Eliot Pearson Department of Child Development at Tufts University. Through his writings, media appearances and lectures in the United States, Canada and abroad he is now recognized as one of the leading advocates for the preservation of childhood. Professor Elkind is the author of over a dozen other books including All Grown Up and No Place to Go, and Miseducation, Preschoolers at Risk.These two books offer excellent perspectives on children, parents, and culture. Psychologist Apter (The Confident Child) argues that we've been hanging on to an idea that's all wrong that when children finish high school or college and land a job, they instantly become autonomous, responsible adults. This "myth of maturity," insists Apter, is harming our kids. These "thresholders" (ages 18-24) appear to function as adults (whether in a job or in school), but in reality they are often in turmoil, depressed, and overwhelmed by life. Apter claims that though parents have been taught that they should end support (emotional, financial, and practical) so that their children can be independent and self-reliant, this is the wrong approach. Each chapter addresses a theme (job stress, finances, college, emotions) with stories of thresholders Apter has interviewed followed by her advice to both parents and thresholders on how to deal with the situation. Myth shatters many common notions we've held for several decades, e.g., it links eating disorders to separation anxiety and lays to rest the idea that the l8-24s are confident, happy, and sexually active beings. Like Elkind, Apter knows that kids grow up fast (that is, they leave childhood) but that they aren't "grown up" at all. Elkind's classic The Hurried Child dates from 1981 and was revised in 1988; now it appears in a third edition. The basic premise remains the same: parents have pushed their children emotionally and intellectually too far, too fast. Today's parents think of their kids as Superkids, so competent and so mature that they need adults very little. Why? Because parents, who are building careers, blending families, or struggling as single parents, have no time for child rearing. Having a competent Superkid relieves these parents of guilt, but it places too much stress on the children themselves. This new edition is fully revised, with new sections on peer-group parent pressure, i.e., the pressure parents feel to go along with the Superkid image out of fear that their own children will lag behind, and on organized sports, the Internet, and software for infants. Like Apter's title, this powerful book is essential reading.

While devoting attention to women of all classes, religions, and ethnicities, the text examines political, economic, intellectual, and social history through the lens of gender. The narrative emphasizes women&#39;s agency over oppression and makes cutting-edge scholarship in women&#39;s history accessible to a wide audience. Five major themes run throughout the narrative: the relationship between key historical events and ideas and women&#39;s lives, the history of the family and sexuality, the social construction of gender, cultural assumptions about women (versus their actual lives), and self perception and women&#39;s place in western societies. A rich collection of primary sources and biographies reinforces these themes.</p><p></p><h2>Mapp &amp; Lucia Omnibus: Queen Lucia, Miss Mapp and Mapp and Lucia</h2><p><b>The official TV tie-in to the new BBC adaptation of E.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS.</p><h2>Haiti, History, and the Gods</h2><p>In <i>Haiti, History, and the Gods,</i> Joan Dayan charts the cultural imagination of Haiti not only by reconstructing the island's history but by highlighting ambiguities and complexities that have been ignored. She investigates the confrontational space in which Haiti is created and recreated in fiction and fact, text and ritual, discourse and practice. Dayan's ambitious project is a research tour de force that gives human dimensions to this eighteenth-century French colony and provides a template for understanding the Haiti of today.<br><br>In examining the complex social fabric of French Saint-Domingue, which in 1804 became Haiti, Dayan uncovers a silenced, submerged past. Instead of relying on familiar sources to reconstruct Haitian history, she uses a startling diversity of voices that have previously been unheard. Many of the materials recovered here&#x2015;overlooked or repressed historical texts, legal documents, religious works, secret memoirs, letters, and literary fictions&#x2015;have never been translated into English. Others, such as Marie Vieux Chauvet's radical novel of vodou, <i>Fonds des N�gres</i>, are seldom used as historical sources.<br><br>Dayan also argues provocatively for the consideration of both vodou rituals and narrative fiction as repositories of history. Her scholarship is enriched by the insights she has gleaned from conversations and experiences during her many trips to Haiti over the past twenty years. Taken together, the material presented in <i>Haiti, History, and the Gods</i> not only restores a lost chapter of Haitian history but suggests necessary revisions to the accepted histories of the New World.</p><p>"By viewing Revolutionary-era Haiti through the lenses of gender and sexuality, Joan Dayan breathes life into an important slice of history."&#x2015;Karen McCarthy Brown, author of <i>Mama Lola</i><b>Joan Dayan,</b> Professor of English at the University of Arizona, is the author of <i>Fables of Mind: An Inquiry into Poe's Fiction</i> (1987) and <i>A Rainbow for the Christian West</i> (1977).</p><h2>Great Reckonings in Little Rooms: On the Phenomenology of Theater</h2><p>This is a book about the theater phenomenon. It is an extension of notes on the theater and theatergoing that have been accumulating for some time. It does not have an argument, or set out to prove a thesis, and it will not be one of those useful books one reads for the fruits of its research. Rather, it is a form of critical description that is phenomenological in the sense that it focuses on the activity of theater making itself out of its essential materials: speech, sound, movement, scenery, text, etc. Like most phenomenological description, it will succeed to the extent that it awakens the reader&#39;s memory of his own perceptual encounters with theater. If the book fails in this it will be about as interesting to read as an anthology of someone else&#39;s dreams. In any case, this book is less concerned with the scientific purity of my perspective and method than with retrieving something from the theater experience that seems to me worthy of our critical admiration.</p><p><b>Bert Olen States</b> was a playwright, critic and a professor emeritus of dramatic arts at the University of California, Santa Barbara.</p><h2>Assessment of Communication Disorders in Adults</h2><p>While combining scholarly information needed for academic courses and practical tools for clinical assessment, this innovative book: <ul><li>* Provides a complete set of common assessment resources and protocols</li><li>* Covers the full range of communication disorders in adults, from aphasia to voice disorders</li><li>* Gives a comprehensive outline of basic assessment procedures</li><li>* Provides a set of protocols that are necessary to assess any communication disorder in adults</li><li>* Addresses the multicultural issues in assessing communication disorders in adults and offers an integrated assessment approach that includes the most desirable features of the traditional and several alternative approaches</li><li>* Contains two chapters for each disorder; one on resources that offers scholarly and research background on the disorder and one on resources that describe practical procedures and protocols that save preparation time and effort for the clinician</li><li>* Has been designed as both a textbook as well as an assessment resource book</li><li>* Includes a CD of test protocols</li></ul></p><p>M.

Unlike her contemporaries, she was concerned less with China's fate as a nation and more with the relationship among patriarchy, imperialism, capitalism, and gender subjugation as global historical problems. This volume, the first translation and study of He-Yin's work in English, critically reconstructs early twentieth-century Chinese feminist thought in a transnational context by juxtaposing He-Yin Zhen's writing against works by two better-known male interlocutors of her time.<br><br>The editors begin with a detailed analysis of He-Yin Zhen's life and thought. They then present annotated translations of six of her major essays, as well as two foundational tracts by her male contemporaries, Jin Tianhe (1874-1947) and Liang Qichao (1873&#x2013;1929), to which He-Yin's work responds and with which it engages. Jin, a poet and educator, and Liang, a philosopher and journalist, understood feminism as a paternalistic cause that liberals like themselves should defend. He-Yin presents an alternative conception that draws upon anarchism and other radical trends. Ahead of her time, He-Yin Zhen complicates conventional accounts of feminism and China's history, offering original perspectives on sex, gender, labor, and power that remain relevant today.</p><p>Lydia H.

Cooper, Jr., Thomas E. Terrill, and Christopher Childers demonstrate their belief that it is impossible to divorce the history of the South from the history of the United States. The authors' analysis underscores the complex interaction between the South as a distinct region and the South as an inescapable part of America. Cooper and Terrill show how the resulting tension has often propelled section and nation toward collision. In supporting their thesis, the authors draw on the tremendous amount of profoundly new scholarship in Southern history. Each volume includes a substantial bibliographical essay&#x2014;completely updated for this edition&#x2014;which provides the reader with a guide to literature on the history of the South. This first volume also includes updated chapters, tables, preface, and prologue.</p><p>William J. Cooper, Jr. is Boyd professor of History at Louisiana State University. <br>Thomas E. Terrill is emeritus professor of History at the University of South Carolina.<br>Christopher Childers is assistant professor of History at Pittsburg State University.As the first full textbook on the region's history, Cooper and Terrill's The American South has long been a staple in undergraduate classrooms, and for good reason. This comprehensive, but concise, history by distinguished scholars of the Old and New South, respectively, serves both students and instructors as an effective introduction and a ready reference. In chronicling the South's distinctive history, the authors are constantly attuned to the fact that its history was always integral to that of the nation as a whole; their ability to so adeptly balance the particular with the general makes this an engaging and eminently teachable narrative. (John C. Inscoe, University of Georgia)<br><br>Combining original analysis with an impressive grasp of relevant scholarship, <i>The American South: A History</i> is distinguished by its wealth of fascinating information and its strong narrative style. It is the kind of book that students want to keep when the course is finished. (Clarence L. Mohr, University of South Alabama)</p><h2>The Roman Family (Ancient Society and History)</h2><p>Unfaithful spouses, divorce and remarriage, rebellious children, aging parents--today&#39;s headlines are filled with issues said to be responsible for a &#34;breakdown&#34; of the traditional family. But are any of these problems truly new? What can we learn from the ways in which societies dealt with them in the past? Suzanne Dixon sets the current debate about the family against a broader context in The Roman Family, the first book to bring together what historians, anthropologists, and philologists have learned about the family in ancient Rome. Dixon begins by reviewing the controversies regarding the family in general and the Roman family in particular. After considering the problems of evidence, she explores what the Roman concept of &#34;family&#34; really meant and how Roman families functioned. Turning to the legal status of the Roman family, she shows how previous studies, which relied exclusively on legal evidence, fell short of describing the reality of Roman life. (Many relations not recognized by law--the slave family, for instance, or the marriage of imperial soldiers--were tolerated socially and eventually gained some legal recognition.) Other topics include love and other aspects of the institution of marriage, the role of the children in the family, how families adjusted to new members, and how they dealt with aging and death.</p><p><p>"One of the very best volumes in the Ancient Society and History series...

How many languages are there? How do we acquire our first language or learn a second one?

David Crystal not only conveys the intrinsic fascination of the subject, but also its enormous complexity. The visual dimension of the encyclopedia throws a fresh light on what has traditionally been treated as a non-visual subject, with many drawings, photographs, maps, display boxes and extracts all integrated within the text. In addition, appendices, meticulous cross-referencing and indexing ensure that this is an authoritative work of reference for students, professionals and general readers alike.</p><p>The most diverse, enjoyable, and thought-provoking encyclopedia on language.

Now, after new discoveries and more than 20 years of intensive work, scholars are able to interpret the written documents and reconstruct from them a vivid picture of life in this remote period, in a way which is impossible from archaeology alone. John Chadwick, who assisted Ventris in the original decipherment, has played a major part in these advances. He now summarizes the results of research and in so doing opens the door to a new world, Mycenaean Greece seen through the eyes of its inhabitants. The tablets may be only, as he describes them, &#39;the account books of anonymous clerks&#39;, but from these prosaic documents he shows how we can infer a bronze industry, foreign slave-women, or even human sacrifice. Not least important is the comparison of the newly available data with the Homeric account, much to the detriment of Homer&#39;s credibility as a witness.</p><p>An extensively illustrated general account of Greece in the 14th and 13th centuries B.C., as reconstructed from contemporary documents and archives by a leading world authority who presents a vivid picture of a long-obscure era.</p><h2>Theories of Nationalism: A Critical Introduction</h2><p><p>This widely-used and highly-acclaimed text provides a comprehensive and balanced introduction to the main theoretical perspectives on nationalism.

The third edition has been revised and updated throughout, and includes a new chapter on the practical implications of theory in the contemporary politics of nationalism. The author situates the major theoretical approaches to nationalism within their historical context, alongside which he presents a unique critique of each theory, and shows how they can be applied to global events in the modern day. In doing so, the text exposes the limits of current discussions on nationalism, and issues a call for an expansion of the agenda of nationalism studies.</p> Accessible and nuanced, the new edition of Theories of Nationalism will be required reading for those studying ethnicity, nations and nationalism across the social sciences and humanities, as well as for the general reader.<p><b>Umut �zk&#x131;r&#x131;ml&#x131;</b>&nbsp;is Professor of Political Science at the Center for Middle Eastern Studies (CMES), Lund University.&nbsp;<br></p></p><h2>Going Down for Air: A Memoir in Search of a Subject (Great Barrington Books) (Charles Lemert Books)</h2><p>What is hidden in the taste of a madeleine - or in snatches of Bob Dylan songs, operatic arias, and the remembered sting of a rattan cane? An exploration of memory, Going Down for Air artfully combines two very different yet connected texts. A Memoir is richly evocative not only of times past, but also of a very English, imperial, queerly masculine subjectivity, caught on the cusp of the extinction of the world in and of which it made sense. Derek Sayer&#39;s allusive writing succeeds as few have done before in capturing the leaps and bounds of memory itself. Rich in its detail, unstinting in its honesty, this beautifully written memoir is a considerable literary achievement. The memoir is complemented by Sayer&#39;s provocative theoretical essay on memory and social identity. Drawing on linguistic and psychoanalytic theory, photographic images, and literary texts, In Search of a Subject argues that it is memory above all that maintains the imagined identities upon which society rests. Going Down for Air is a bold and strikingly successful literary and sociological experiment, which makes a major contribution to understanding how our memories work - and gives them social meaning far beyond</p><p>Derek Sayer, University of Alberta, Canada, and Lancaster University, England, is the author of The Great Arch (with Philip Corrigan, 1985), Capitalism and Modernity (1991), and The Coasts of Bohemia (1998).</p><h2>The Ivy League (Trade)</h2><p><br>Much more than a grouping of eight colleges and universities, the Ivy League with its hallowed halls, private clubs, and grassy quadrangles is the consummate reward of the American Dream.

Eisenman</b> is Professor of Art History at Northwestern University. Contributors include: Thomas Crow, Brian Lukacher, Linda Nochlin, David Llewellyn Phillips, Frances K. Pohl.The political, industrial, and cultural revolutions that punctuated the 19th century were reflected in the fine arts, though not always consciously. Art was no longer the sole domain of the upper classes, and the complexity of the new social order became evident in the works of artists like Blake and Goya early in the century and Cassatt and Eakins later on. In this first comprehensive reconsideration of 19th-century art from the viewpoint of the "new" art history, Eisenman and four other art historians examine issues of class, gender, racism, and Eurocentrism as they pertain to North American and European art.

As guardians of the archive until they bequeathed it to the Bodleian in 1892, Sir Percy Florence and Lady Jane helped shape the posthumous reputations of these writers.

Its cultural approach emphasizes the political and economic significance of shifting conceptions of, and forms of participation in, an increasingly compressed world. At the same time the book shows why culture has become a globally contested issue - why, for example, competing conceptions of `world order&#x2032; have political and economic consequences.</p></p><p>Roland Robertson is Professor of Sociology at the University of Pittsburgh.

The author is a sociologist with a special <p></p> <p>interest in the social function of religion, which colours his analysis . Originally published in 1992 it stresses the relative autonomy of culture but misses the later discussions on the economic globalization, </p> <p>which may explain the author&#x2032;s criticism of the interpretation of globalization as an expression of the Western modernity project&#x2032; -<b><i> New Routes</i></b></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i></p> <p>`This is an ambitious book and a work of prodigious scholarship. Its aim is to reclaim culture for social theory.... this is an essential book&#x2032; - <b><i>The Journal of International Communication</i></b></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i></p> <p>`Is a good guide to the `globalization&#x2032; area... it is head and shoulders above any other text in the area&#x2032; - <b><i>Stewart R Clegg, Asia Pacific Business Review</i></b></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i></p> <p>`There is much in this book which is relevant to the contemporary condition which demands critical attention... This is a book which should appeal to a broad sociological readership&#x2032; - <b><i>The Journal of Contingencies and Crisis Management</i></b></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i></p> <p>`Robertson&#x2032;s approach to globalization is multidimensional, complex, well-grounded in soicological theory, and centred on culture - so often the stepchild in other approaches. His work on globalization is not nearly as well known as that of Giddens, probably because his articles have been scattered in difficult to find journals. This is remedied by this book, in which the common theme of globaliztion is developed in relation to such concerns as the cultural turn, world-systems theory, the civilizing process, modernity and postmodernity, nostalgia politics and fundamentalism. Robertson fruitfully contrasts his approach to that of Wallerstein, Elias and Giddens.... his contribution is in several respects original, probes deeply and is highly stimulating<i>&#x2032; </i>- <b><i>Political Studies</i></b></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i></p> <p>`Enormously fruitful.... impressive.... this volume manages to work very well and provides a good introduction to many of the questions that underlie the phenomenon of globalization while standing as a sustained and stimulating interpretive essay in its own right.... is impressive and highly readable and deserves to be widely read<i>&#x2032; - </i>I<b><i>nternational Affairs</i></b></p><b><i> </i></b><i></i><p><i><b></b></i></p> <p>`In an era of increasing integration of economies and political systems and, concomitantly, the disintegration of former socialist planned economies, the discussion of global integration and order is timely and important. Robertson&#x2032;s globalization theory attempts to discuss increasing global integration and interpenetration along four main dimensions: internationalization, societalization, indivdualization and humanization. His approach is voluntaristic and neofunctional and is pitched at both micro and macro levels. The world systems perspective, which is an alternative to globalization theory, comes under Robertson&#x2032;s scrutiny, and his critique of this perspective is one of the more sophisticated non-Marxist ones to date... The book&#x2032;s insightful theory can be used to examine macro and micro aspects of the current conditions. Its inherent comprehensive approach would be of interest not only to macrosociologists but also to those studying postmodernity, gender, ethnicity and identity<i>&#x2032;</i> - <b><i>Contemporary Sociology</i></b></p></p><h2>Disorders of Personality: Introducing a DSM / ICD Spectrum from Normal to Abnormal</h2><p>Now in&nbsp;its <i>Third Edition</i>, this book clarifies the distinctions between the vast array of personality disorders and helps clinicians make accurate diagnoses. It has been thoroughly updated to incorporate the&nbsp;changes in the forthcoming DSM-5. Using the classification scheme he pioneered, Dr. Millon guides clinicians through the intricate maze of personality disorders, with special attention to changes in their conceptualization over the last decade. Extensive new research is included, as well as the incorporation of over 50 new illustrative and therapeutically detailed cases. This is every mental health&nbsp;professional's essential volume to fully understanding personality. <br><br> <strong>From the Author: Does Psychiatry Itself Have a Personality Problem?</strong><br> <br> From early in the 20th century, Freud, Adler and Jung wrangled over whose treatment approach was best. Now, today, there are literally dozens of therapies, each vying for its preeminence, shifting yearly in their &#x201c;popularity&#x201d;, from psychodynamic to pharmaceuticals, to behavioral, to cognitive, to family, and who knows what else? <br><br> No less troubling is psychiatry&#x2019;s inability to maintain a decent measure of clarity or stability in its diagnostic Bible, the DSM, now undergoing its fifth revision in recent decades, and stirring up powerful controversies as it presses for further radical changes since the innovative DSM-III and DSM-IV. What are being proposed is the recasting or dropping of such classical syndromes as the paranoid, the narcissistic, the schizoid and the histrionic (hysterical) personality, while proposing the ascendance of recent types such as the schizotypal, avoidant and borderline. Are these changes a scientifically based index of &#x201c;survival of the fittest&#x201d; or another fad of the times, to be recast again in the DSM-6? <br><br> It appears that the psychiatric profession can&#x2019;t make up its own mind about what disorders exist and how best to treat them. If they were a patient, they would likely be &#x201c;diagnosed&#x201d; with the &#x201c;borderline personality&#x201d; label, a disorder noted for its identity confusion, instability, impulsive mood changes, periodic feelings of emptiness, and self-injurious behaviors. Chaos does seem to reign in the consulting room, but who has the disorder, the doctor or the patient?</p><p><b>Theodore Millon</b>, Ph.D., D.Sc. is one of the world's leading authorities on personality disorders. Developer of the widely used Millon personality assessment inventories, he has been the editor of the <i>Journal of Personality Disorders</i>, President of the International Society of Personality Disorders, and a key member of the DSM-III, DSM-IV, and and key advisor to the DSM-5 committees on personality disorders. <br>Dr. Millon is retired Professor of Harvard Medical School and the University of Miami. He is currently Dean and Scientific Director of the Institute for Advanced Studies in Personology and Psychopathology in Coral Gables, FL. He is author of numerous other Wiley books, including <i>Masters of the Mind: Exploring the Story of Mental Illness from Ancient Times to the New Millennium, Personality Disorders in Modern Life, 2E,</i> and Wiley's forthcoming 15-book <i>Normality to Abnormality Personality Series<i>.</i></i>"The current text, <i>Disorders of Personality: Introducing a DSM/ICD Spectrum from Normal to Abnormal</i>, is the third edition of this classic within the field of personality disorder. Millon's greatest skill is his scholarly acumen, and this is on full display within this rich, erudite volume. If clinicians, scholars, or researchers whish to know anything about the history of personality disorder classification, the first place to look would be this book. It is likely that all questions will be answered.... This third edition does include new material. Millon has further developed his evolutionary theoretical model, he has added discussions of 50 new therapy cases, he indicates the normal variants of each personality disorder, he includes a dimensional schema of traits for therapeutic planning, and he even introduces a completely new personality disorder diagnosis: the ebullient/exuberant/turbulent personality type.... The strength of this text is in its coverage of the far past and recent history of personality disorder conceptualization and classification, and that does not change much. Plus, to Millon's credit, although he presents these volumes as companions to a respective edition to the diagnostic manual, he has not revised his nomenclature simply to conform to what is included in the DSM. He continued to endorse the passive-aggressive and sadistic personality disorders when they were removed, and now he continues to endorse the histrionic, paranoid, and schizoid personality disorders." &#x2015;Thomas A.

By the time the war ended in 1918, millions lay dead. Three major empires lay shattered by defeat, those of Germany, Austria-Hungary, and the Ottomans. A fourth, Russia, was in the throes of a revolution that helped define the rest of the twentieth century. <br><br><em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the First World War</em> brings together in one volume many of the most distinguished historians of the conflict, in an account that matches the scale of the events. From its causes to its consequences, from the Western Front to the Eastern, from the strategy of the politicians to the tactics of the generals, they chart the course of the war and assess its profound political and human consequences. Chapters on economic mobilization, the impact on women, the role of propaganda, and the rise of socialism establish the wider context of the fighting at sea and in the air, and which ranged on land from the trenches of Flanders to the mountains of the Balkans and the deserts of the Middle East. <br><br>First published for the 90th anniversary of the 1918 Armistice, this highly illustrated revised edition contains significant new material to mark the 100th anniversary of the war.</p><p><p><b>A Look Inside <em>The Oxford Illustrated History of the First World War</em></b></p> <em> </em> <em>After the February revolution, Maria Botchkareva, who served in the tsarist army, was asked by Kerensky to form a &#x201c;battalion of death,&#x201d; made up exclusively of women.</em> <em> </em> <em>Women had formed nursing units for service with the British army in the Crimean War, and continued to do so until 1914.</em> &nbsp; <em> </em> <em>The women of America were urged to follow the militant example of Joan of Arc and buy War Savings Stamps.</em> <em> </em> <em>This American poster, produced shortly after the USA entered the war, was designed to encourage support for the allied war effort, and remind the public of what the French people were going through.</em><br><strong>Sir Hew Strachan</strong> was born in Edinburgh in 1949, and was educated at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, where he was a Fellow between 1975 and 1992.

In his provocative book, the author shows how key Jewish theologians faced the memory of Auschwitz by rejecting traditional theodicy, abandoning any attempt to justify and vindicate the relationship between God and catastrophic suffering. The author terms this rejection "Antitheodicy," the refusal to accept that relationship. It finds voice in the writings of three particular theologians: Richard Rubenstein, Eliezer Berkovits, and Emil Fackenheim.</p><br><p> This book is the first to bring postmodern philosophical and literary approaches into conversation with post-Holocaust Jewish thought. Drawing on the work of Mieke Bal, Harold Bloom, Jacques Derrida, Umberto Eco, Michel Foucault, and others, Braiterman assesses how Jewish intellectuals reinterpret Bible and Midrash to re-create religious thought for the age after Auschwitz.</p><br><p> In this process, he provides a model for reconstructing Jewish life and philosophy in the wake of the Holocaust. His work contributes to the postmodern turn in contemporary Jewish studies and today's creative theology.</p></p><p><b>Zachary Braiterman</b> is Assistant Professor of Religion at Syracuse University.</p><h2>Selling Your Business For Dummies</h2><p><b>A hands-on tool for conducting the successful, profitable sale of a business</b><br> <br> As business owners gray, trends have shown that they start thinking of cashing out. <i>Selling Your Business For Dummies</i> gives readers expert tips on every aspect of selling a business, from establishing a realistic value to putting their business on the market to closing the deal.

It emphasizes real-world applications and an &#x201c;outside-in approach&#x201d; as well as the history and human side of mineralogy. <b></b> Chapter topics include elements and minerals; crystallization and classification of minerals; mineral properties: hand specimen mineralogy; optical mineralogy; igneous rocks and silicate minerals; sedimentary minerals and sedimentary rocks; metamorphic minerals and metamorphic rocks; ore deposits and economic minerals; crystal morphology and symmetry; crystallography; units cells, points, lines, and planes; x-ray diffraction; atomic structure; and descriptions of minerals. <b></b> For individuals interested in the science of mineralogy, and how minerals impact everyday life. </p></p><p><p> Several excellent mineralogy texts are available today. They are well written, contain good figures and tables, and are complete. In short, they make excellent reference books, and I am glad I have them on my shelf. However, in my experience they are not appropriate for undergraduate mineralogy courses because they do not stimulate students or present information in ways that help students learn. Of course, the most enthusiastic and self-motivated students always do well and enjoy learning, and they may enjoy any well-written book, but many of my students are not of this ilk. They are good students, but many of them have, over the years, expressed frustration and dissatisfaction with mineralogy texts and, consequently, the way that mineralogy is taught. </p> <p> As I see it, the major problem is one of thinking. In particular, it is a problem stemming from scientific minds that picture the world as a bunch of facts that, when combined, add up to big pictures. I find that most mineralogy students are bored by facts and often have not developed the imagination or perseverance needed to see their implications. As a scientist, I don't have a problem starting with atoms and atomic theory and building to molecules, crystals, rocks, regions, continents, and the Earth. I have no problem spending time discussing symmetry before I discuss minerals. It doesn't bother me if a class or an article never gets beyond interesting details and abstractions, or if a particular topic is never fully related to any other. However, as a teacher, I find that the scientific way of thinking is not the students' way of learning. Most students, in fact, seem to learn best by starting with the big things they know and understand&#x2014;a rock or a pretty crystal, for instance&#x2014;and then focusing on details and, finally, abstractions. They are interested and stimulated only when they understand the context and implications of the material they are learning. This means that the order and presentation of subjects in available mineralogy books are in many ways opposite from what can best promote learning. </p> <p> Most of today's students won't be mineralogists and few will be petrologists. They don't need to know all the details of crystallography, crystal chemistry, and many other things we have taught in the past. Instead, they need to know how to think, they need to appreciate science and how it works, and, if they are to go on to careers in the Earth sciences, they need to know how minerals fit into a bigger picture. </p> <p> This is the second edition of <i>Mineralogy</i> but, like the first, it approaches the subject of mineralogy from a student's perspective. My goal is to provide a book that students will enjoy reading and that will help them learn and become excited about the science I have made my career. I have tried to emphasize ideas and thinking and to relate mineralogy to other sciences. Consequently, I have deemphasized facts and sacrificed some completeness. Most, but not all, of the same material found in other mineralogy books is included, but the order, presentation, and depth of coverage are different. Mineralogical purists may say that I have strayed into different disciplines or that I have omitted some important details. Of these crimes I am guilty; but I have not done this without thought, and I hope that my thinking has been consistent with my goals. </p> <p> When I wrote the first edition of this book, I was asked what would make it different and successful. I am not sure what makes a book successful, but the most important things that make this book different from others are </p> <ul> <li>With the exception of the first chapter, topics are covered beginning with the big, easy-to-see picture and ending with the details and theory.</li> <li>Topics are not completely divided into separate chapters as in many books; there is overlap and some redundancy.</li> <li>In an attempt to put mineralogy in context, I have placed more emphasis on petrology, chemistry, and other sciences not normally considered mineralogy.</li> <li>The history and human side of mineralogy&#x2014;individuals and their contributions&#x2014;have received more emphasis and are placed in better context than in other books.</li> <li>Boxed material relates mineralogy to things that are relevant to our daily lives.</li> <li>Jargon, classification schemes, and other vocabulary are only mentioned when important, and they are never emphasized.</li> <li>This book includes a glossary of over 1000 mineralogical terms.</li> <li>This book is not a complete mineralogy reference book; some things have been omitted or covered only briefly.</li> <li>I have tried to write in a style that is easy to read and less rigid than many science texts.</li> <li>Every chapter includes some "Questions for Thought." Most of the questions do not have absolutely correct answers. Instead, they require thinking about the material in the chapter and combining it with material learned elsewhere. They are intended to stimulate student thought and discussion and to inspire students to look in other books or journals for information.</li> <li>With some additions, and with emphasis on Chapters 1-8, this text could form the basis for a combined mineralogy/petrology course.</li> </ul> <p> In this, the second edition, I have made some significant changes. Many photos and line drawings have been replaced, and new topical boxes have been added. I have omitted some of the more tedious parts of the first edition, replacing them with more information relating mineralogy to the world around us. Additionally, this edition is accompanied by a CD-Rom that contains over 400 high-quality mineral photographs. </p> <p> This book would not have been possible without an incredible amount of help from my friends and others. So many people have contributed that listing them all would add another chapter. Al Falster and others provided some photos for this book, but I am especially indebted to Alan Kantrud who took many photographs for me and taught me how to take my own. I am also indebted to Eric Dowty and Shape Software for providing graphics software and data files to create crystal structure drawings. </p> <p> Thanks go the following reviewers: Penelope Morton, University of Minnesota-Duluth; William P Leeman, Rice University; David L. Smith, La Salle University; Jeffery Ryan, University of South Florida; Jennifer A. Thomson, Eastern Washington University; Julia Nord, George Mason University; Philip Goodell, University of Texas at El Paso. </p> <p> In the final analysis, the success or failure of any textbook depends on how it is received by students and teachers who use it. I hope you like <i>Mineralogy</i> and will tell me of things I can do to make it more useful and enjoyable. </p> <p> Dexter Perkins </p></p><h2>Biomedical Engineering for Global Health (Cambridge Texts in Biomedical Engineering)</h2><p>Can technology and innovation transform world health?

Educators must pass the Professional Education Test as one of the requirements for their first five-year Florida Professional Certificate. You are eligible to take the test if you meet any one of these criteria: <br>� Enrolled in a college or university teacher-preparation program<br>� Teaching with provisional certification<br>� Making a teaching career change to public school teaching &nbsp; Consult the Florida Department of Education's Bureau of Educator Certification at <i>www.fldoe.org/edcert</i> to determine what tests are appropriate for you. <br>If you do <i>not </i>do well on the FTCE, don&#x2019;t panic! The test can be taken again, so you can work on improving your score in preparation for your next FTCE. A score on the FTCE that does not match your expectations does <i>not </i>mean you should change your plans about teaching.<br><b>&nbsp;</b><br><b>Who administers the test?</b><br>The FTCE is developed and administered by the Florida Department of Education with the assistance of Pearson Education, Inc. A test development process was designed and implemented to ensure that the content and difficulty level of the test are appropriate.<br><b>&nbsp; </b> <b>When should the FTCE be taken?<br></b>The test should be taken just before or right after graduation for those seeking certification right out of school. While the FTCE is required to teach in Florida, you may be issued a three-year temporary certificate while completing your teaching requirements and working toward passing the FTCE itself.<br> &nbsp; Computer-based tests are offered throughout the year in many locations; you simply schedule an appointment at a testing center. Paper-based tests are offered about six times per year at fixed times and locations Special accommodations can also be made for applicants who are visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically disabled, or specific learning disabled.<br> To receive information on upcoming administrations of the FTCE, consult the FTCE Registration Bulletin, which can be obtained by contacting:<br><br>FTCE/FELE Program Pearson Evaluation Systems<br>PO Box 660<br>Amherst, MA 01004-9018 Phone: (413) 256-2893<br>Website: <i>www.fl.nesinc.com</i><br> The FTCE Registration Bulletin also includes information regarding test retakes and score reports.<br><br><b>Is there a registration fee?<br></b>To take the FTCE, you must pay a registration fee. You may pay by personal check, money order, cashier&#x2019;s check, or Visa or MasterCard. Cash is not accepted.<br><br><b>How to Use This Book<br><br>What do I study first?<br></b>Read over the reviews and the suggestions for test-taking. Studying the reviews thoroughly will reinforce the basic skills you will need to do well on the exam. Make sure to take the practice tests to become familiar with the format and procedures involved with taking the actual FTCE. &nbsp; To best utilize your study time, follow our FTCE Independent Study Schedule located at the end of this chapter. The schedule is based on a seven-week program, but can be condensed to four weeks if necessary.<br><br><b>When should I start studying?<br></b>It is never too early to start studying for the FTCE. The earlier you begin, the more time you will have to sharpen your skills. Do not procrastinate! Cramming is <i>not </i>an effective way to study, since it does not allow you the time needed to learn the test material.<br><br><b>Format of the FTCE<br></b>The Professional Education Test features 120 questions designed to assess your knowledge of the information described in the competencies included in our review sections.<br><br>The test covers the 14 teaching competencies identified by the Florida Department of Education as foundational to effective teaching. Mastery of the content included in each of the competencies is gauged by one or more items on the examination. Individual test items require a variety of different thinking levels, ranging from simple recall to evaluation and problem solving.<br><br>The competencies are broad statements written in a way that reflects the information an entry-level educator needs in order to be a truly effective teacher. Within the review section, each competency is broken down into the competency statement and a description of what the competency covers. The competencies will not be discussed in the actual FTCE test.<br><br>All the questions on the FTCE are in multiple-choice format. Each question will have four options, lettered A through D, from which to choose. You should have plenty of time in which to complete the FTCE, but be aware of the amount of time you are spending on each question so that you allow yourself time to complete the test. Although speed is not very important, a steady pace should be maintained when answering the questions. Using the practice tests will help you prepare for this task.<br><br><b>Computer-Based Testing<br></b> Every test in the FTCE program may be taken as a computer-based or paper-based test, both of which are equivalent in length and difficulty. If you elect to take the computer-based test, you need to know only a few computer skills, such as using a mouse, clicking, double-clicking, dragging, and scrolling. A tutorial is offered preceding each computer-based test so you can become familiar with the screen and the functions. At the conclusion of the test, you will instantly receive an unofficial score, as well as your pass/fail status. <br><b>About the Review Sections<br></b>The reviews in this book are designed to help you sharpen the basic knowledge needed to approach the FTCE, as well as provide strategies for attacking the questions.<br><br>Each teaching competency is examined in a separate chapter. All 14 competencies are extensively discussed to sharpen your understanding of what the FTCE covers.<br><br>Your schooling has taught you most of what you need to answer the questions on the test. The education classes you took should have provided you with the know-how to make important decisions about situations you will face as a teacher. Our review is designed to help you fit the information you have acquired into specific competency components. Reviewing your class notes and textbooks<br>together with our competency reviews will give you an excellent springboard for passing the FTCE.<br><br><b>Scoring the FTCE<br><br>How do I score my practice test?<br></b>There are a total of 120 questions on the FTCE Professional Education Test. A score of 200 or higher, which is equivalent to 73% correct, is needed to pass. In other words, you need to answer approximately 88 questions correctly to achieve a passing score.<br><br>If you do not achieve a passing score, review the detailed explanations for the questions you answered incorrectly. Note which types of questions you answered wrong, and re-examine the corresponding review. After further review, you may want to retake the practice tests.<br><br><b>When will I receive my score report, and what will it look like?<br></b> Unofficial score reports are available through the FTCE website after 5:00 p.m. on the day of the test. Official score reports are issued approximately 2 weeks after each computer-based test, and approximately one month after each paper-based test. Your scores will be submitted electronically to the Bureau of Educator Certification. &nbsp; A copy of your score report is provided to one Florida college or university and one Florida school district. You should have requested this information on your registration application. &nbsp; When you receive your score report and have passed with a 200 or higher, only the word PASS will be reported. If you do not pass, you will receive a numeric score and will have to retake the test.<br><br><b>Studying for the FTCE<br></b>It is very important for you to choose the time and place for studying that works best for you. Some individuals may set aside a certain number of hours every morning to study, while others may choose to study at night before going to sleep. Other people may study during the day, while waiting on line, or even while eating lunch. Only you can determine when and where your study time will be most effective. Be consistent and use your time wisely. Work out a stud routine and stick to it.<br><br>When you take the practice tests, simulate the conditions of the actual test as closely as possible. Turn your television and radio off, and sit down at a quiet table free from distraction.<br><br>As you complete each practice test, score your test and thoroughly review the explanations to the questions you answered incorrectly; however, do not review too much at any one time. Concentrate on one problem area at a time by reviewing the question and explanation, and by studying our review until you are confident that you have mastered the material.<br><br>Keep track of your scores. By doing so, you will be able to gauge your progress and discover general weaknesses in particular sections. Give extra attention to the reviews that cover your areas of difficulty, as this will build your skills in those areas.<br><br><b>Test-Taking Tips<br></b>Although you may not be familiar with tests like the FTCE, this book will help acquaint you with this type of exam and help alleviate your test-taking anxieties. Listed below are ways to help you become accustomed to the FTCE, some of which may be applied to other tests as well.<br><br><i>Become comfortable with the test conditions of the FTCE. </i>When you are practicing, simulate the conditions under which you will be taking the actual test. Stay calm and pace yourself. After simulating the test only once, you will boost your chances of doing well, and you will be able to sit down for the actual FTCE with much more confidence.<br><br><i>Read all of the possible answers. </i>Just because you think you have found the correct response, do not automatically assume that it is the best answer. Read through each choice to be sure that you are not making a mistake by jumping to conclusions.<br><br><i>Use the process of elimination. </i>Go through each answer to a question and eliminate as many of the answer choices as possible. By eliminating two answer choices, you have given yourself a better chance of getting the item correct since there will only be two choices left from which to make your guess. Do not leave an answer blank; it is better to guess than to not answer a question on the FTCE test.<br><br><i>Work quickly and steadily. </i>You will have two-and-one-half hours to complete the test, so work quickly and steadily to avoid focusing on any one problem too long. Taking the practice tests in this book will help you learn to budget your precious time.<br><i></i><br><i>Learn the directions and format of the test. </i>Familiarizing yourself with the directions and format of the test will not only save time, but will also help you avoid anxiety (and the mistakes caused by getting anxious).<br><i></i><br><i>Be sure that the answer circle you are marking corresponds to the number of the question in the test booklet or on the screen. </i>Since the test is multiple-choice, it is graded by machine, and marking one wrong answer can throw off your answer key and your score. Be extremely careful.<br><br><b>The Day of the Test</b> <br><b>Before the Test<br></b>On the day of the test, make sure to dress comfortably, so that you are not distracted by being too hot or too cold while taking the test. Plan to arrive at the test center early. This will allow you to collect your thoughts and relax before the test, and will also spare you the anguish that comes with being late. You should check your FTCE Registration Bulletin to find out what time to arrive at the testing center.<br><br>Before you leave for the test center, make sure that you have your admission ticket and two forms of identification. Both forms of identification must be valid, unexpired, and printed in English. The first must be government-issued and have a photograph and signature (e.g. driver&#x2019;s license, state-issued ID, US Military ID, or passport). The second form of identification must have either a photo or signature (e.g. Social Security card or student ID). You will not be admitted to the test center if you do not have proper identification.<br><i></i><br><i>If you are taking the paper-based test, you must bring several sharpened No. 2 pencils with erasers, as none will be provided at the test center. Also bring blue or black ball-point pens. </i> If you would like, you may wear a watch to the test center. However, you may not wear one that makes noise, because it may disturb the other test takers. Cell phones, electronic devices, paper, dictionaries, textbooks, notebooks, calculators, briefcases, or packages will not be permitted. Drinking, smoking, and eating are prohibited.<br><br><b>During the Test<br></b>The FTCE is given in one sitting with no breaks. Procedures will be followed to maintain test security. &nbsp; Once you enter the test center, follow all of the rules and instructions given by the test supervisor. If you do not, you risk being dismissed from the test and having your scores cancelled. &nbsp; When all of the materials have been distributed, the test instructor will give you directions for filling out your answer sheet or online form. Fill out this form carefully since this information will be printed on your score report.<br><br>Once the test begins, mark only one answer per question. On the paper-based test, completely erase unwanted answers and marks, and fill in answers darkly and neatly.<br><br><b>After the Test<br></b>When you finish your test, hand in your materials and you will be dismissed. Then, go home and relax&#x2014;you deserve it!<br> <br></p><h2>Exodus (Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible)</h2><p>Exodus recounts the origins of ancient Israel, but it is also a book of religious symbols. How should it be interpreted, especially in light of modern historical-critical study? In this addition to an acclaimed series, a respected scholar offers a theological reading of Exodus that highlights Aquinas&#39;s interpretations of the text. As with other volumes in the series, this commentary is ideal for those called to ministry, serving as a rich resource for preachers, teachers, students, and study groups.</p><p><b>Praise for the Brazos Theological Commentary on the Bible<br></b><br>"[Robert] Barron's achievement [in <i>2 Samuel</i>] is crazy good. It would be trite and yet true to say that he writes well or that his commentary reads like a novel. . . . Barron's reservoir of allusion is impressive, and his helpful references to history and literature are more than adornment. . . . He helps readers to see the broader story. His grasp of the complex development of David's character is unsurpassed. . . . As a preacher under weekly pressure to cobble a sermon together, I find myself loving Barron and his book."<br>--<b>Anne Blue Wills</b>, <i>Christian Century</i><br><br>"[In <i>2 Samuel</i>, Robert] Barron trains his theological eye on the account of the rise and fall of King David. He moves through the biblical book chapter by chapter, weaving together insights from the reconstruction of ancient history, biblical exegesis, and the Christian theological tradition. . . . It is clear that Barron knows this biblical book quite well. He is also well acquainted with the history of its interpretation. This study is a fine example of postcritical doctrinal biblical interpretation."<br>--<b>Dianne Bergant, CSA</b>, <i>The Bible Today</i><br><br>"The series in which [<i>Luke</i>] appears shows what is gained when biblical commentaries are written by those who are expert in the related field of theology. In this case [David Lyle Jeffrey] is also learned not only in biblical studies but also (and primarily) in English literature. The resulting volume thus combines expert knowledge of the usual grist in the commentator's mill with other helpful disciplines. . . . The outcome is a surprisingly comprehensive approach to the text which pays attention to matters of literary structure that are theologically relevant."<br>--<b>I.

Marshall</b>, Perkins School of Theology, Southern Methodist University<br><br>"White's reading of Exodus tackles head-on the peculiarly modern conceit that all that stands between the reader of scripture and wise reading is a lack of knowledge--a deficiency of information. Surely, say White and the Catholic tradition to which he hereby contributes, as readers we typically lack the moral formation to see clearly the text and its truths. As such, we take a journey in tandem with the Israelites: from darkness to light and from slavery in Egypt to life-giving service (and understanding) under God's law. Drawing deeply on the fourfold sense of scripture in dialogue with Aquinas and many other serious theological voices, this commentary will strengthen and challenge all readers in pursuit of the God to whom the book of Exodus bears witness."<br>--<b>Richard S. Briggs</b>, Cranmer Hall, St. John's College, Durham University<br><br>"In his introduction to this extraordinary commentary and reflection on Exodus, Fr. Thomas Joseph White, OP, writes that 'the classical Catholic approach to the moral law on Exodus is in many ways convergent with Judaism.' Thus I can now better understand why Maimonides (who so greatly influenced Thomas Aquinas, Fr. White's <i>auctoritas</i>) taught that Jews like me may learn Torah with Christians like Fr. White, who accept the Torah as divine revelation. In addition to that theological commonality (with differences to be sure), I very much identify with Fr.

I like the tone, the examples, and the additional images especially. I note that throughout the text there are references to other cultural developments (stories from Ovid serving as inspiration for Shakespeare plots, for example). I like these connections very much. The 'Compare &amp; Contrast' section is potentially more valuable because of the images paired with it, which will give the students a stronger idea of the concept under discussion. I do like the Colosseum/sports arena pairing, which I find useful. The Colosseum is certainly one of Rome's major monuments and the choice of this to connect with modern examples is logical and useful. The separate section is an extension of this comparative theme as a whole, one with a bit more depth. I think it is a positive one; I like it."<br><br>"Despite having read many textbooks on the same topics, I found reading this book pleasurable due to the writing style."</p><h2>Surgical Instruments: A Pocket Guide (Wells, Surgical Instruments)</h2><p>This quick reference provides need-to-know information about surgical instrument types in a consistent, user-friendly format.

J. Richards, is the attempt to understand the implications of the Reconstruction Amendments--Amendments Thirteen, Fourteen, and Fifteen to the United States Constitution. Richards evaluates previous efforts to interpret the amendments and then proposes his own view: together the amendments embodied a self-conscious rebirth of America's revolutionary, rights-based constitutionalism. Building on an approach to constitutional law developed in his <i>Toleration and the Constitution</i> and <i>Foundations of American Constitutionalism</i>, Richards links history, law, and political theory. In <i>Conscience and the Constitution</i>, this method leads from an analysis of the Reconstruction Amendments to a broad discussion of the American constitutional system as a whole.</p><p>Richards's interpretation focuses on the abolitionists and their radical commitment to the "dissenting conscience." In his view, the Reconstruction Amendments expressed not only the constitutional arguments of a particular historical period but also a general political theory developed by the abolitionists, who restructured the American political community in terms of respect for universal human rights. He argues further that the amendments make a claim on our generation to keep faith with the vision of the "founders of 1865." In specific terms he points out what such allegiance would mean in the context of present-day constitutional issues.</p><p>Originally published in 1993.</p><p>The <b>Princeton Legacy Library</b> uses the latest print-on-demand technology to again make available previously out-of-print books from the distinguished backlist of Princeton University Press.

Even so, you may be reading it less well than you could. The fact is, you probably learned to read the wrong way, but somehow you've managed to get by, even do well. Many children and adults are not so lucky. </p><p>In America today, 43 percent of our children test below grade level in reading. Among adults, 42 million are functionally illiterate. The numbers are staggering, but in our schools, the problem is only getting worse. Most schools teach reading with phonics, the whole language method, or some eclectic combination of the two. Unfortunately, these methods are failing our children; phonics by 30 percent, whole language by 50 percent. </p><p>We are in crisis. Now, what are we going to do about it? If we're wise, we'll read and use what's in this book at home -- and in every school in America -- because it is the first thorough diagnosis of the problem and the first viable solution. The old methods don't work, and this book will tell you why. Psychologist Diane McGuinness draws on twenty-five years of solid reading research that shows exactly how the current system fails and how to fix it. </p><p>She explains that the ability to read depends on the ability to hear the sounds of our language correctly, and on a working knowledge of something called the spelling code, which is the key to how English spelling works: what letters and letter combinations go with which sounds. This connection of sounds and the symbols that represent them is crucial to learning how to read, and McGuinness explains it with rigor, clarity, and expertise. Moreover, she shows how this method is scientifically proven and has transformed so-called dyslexics and troubled readers into expert readers and spellers, often in astoundingly short periods of time. </p><p>Diane McGuinness has given us the blueprint for a reading revolution -- one that offers real hope to the millions of children and adults who are failing needlessly in school and in life.</p>Diane McGuinness, Ph.D. , is a cognitive developmental psychologist and professor at the University of South Florida.

This has been brought about by the introduction of linear algebra into the curriculum at the sophomore level. The advantages of using linear algebra both in the teaching of differential equations and in the teaching of multivariate calculus are by now widely recognized. Several textbooks adopting this point of view are now available and have been widely adopted. Students completing the sophomore year now have a fair preliminary under� standing of spaces of many dimensions. It should be apparent that courses on the junior level should draw upon and reinforce the concepts and skills learned during the previous year. Unfortunately, in differential geometry at least, this is usually not the case. Textbooks directed to students at this level generally restrict attention to 2-dimensional surfaces in 3-space rather than to surfaces of arbitrary dimension. Although most of the recent books do use linear algebra, it is only the algebra of ~3. The student&#39;s preliminary understanding of higher dimensions is not cultivated.</p><p><br></p><h2>Agile!: The Good, the Hype and the Ugly</h2><p>Here is the ideal introduction to agile development.

We are told that under the pressure of increasing globalisation, it is India and China that are the new world manufacturing powerhouses. However, this is not a new phenomenon: until the industrial revolution, Asia manufactured great quantities of colourful printed cottons that were sold to places as far afield as Japan, West Africa and Europe. Cotton explores this earlier globalised economy and its transformation after 1750 as cotton led the way in the industrialisation of Europe. By the early nineteenth century, India, China and the Ottoman Empire switched from world producers to buyers of European cotton textiles, a position that they retained for over two hundred years. This is a fascinating and insightful story which ranges from Asian and European technologies and African slavery to cotton plantations in the Americas and consumer desires across the globe.</p><p>A fascinating account of how cotton transformed the world we live in today: it industrialised Europe and became the first item to be traded globally.

This fine version of <em>The Iliad</em> has a feel for the Greek." --<em>Library Journal</em><p></p><br>"With swift, transparent language that rings both ancient and modern, Barry Powell gives readers anew all of the rage, pleasure, pathos, and humor that are Homer's <em>Iliad</em>--a reading experience richly illumined by the insightful commentary and plentiful images accompanying the text." --Jane Alison, author of <em>The Love-Artist</em><p></p><br>"This translation is the complete package. A lucid and accessible introduction gives a general audience what they need to appreciate the nature of this extraordinary poem, and the translation itself is admirably energetic, readable, and direct. Powell's style is individual and self-assured, and his lines cry out to be read aloud. Just as in the original, the pace never lets up and the events of that long-lost past flash by. It is a remarkable achievement, one that fully deserves to rank with any of the current contenders." --Denis Feeney, Princeton University<p></p><br>"Barry Powell's clever translation is simple and energetic: sometimes coarse, sometimes flowing, it is always poetically engaged. He lays bare the semantic background of Homer through felicitous phrasing and delivers us a Dark-Age epic, one more suggestive of Norse sagas than the cultural milieu of archaic Ionia. Fresh and eminently readable, Powell's <em>Iliad</em> is likely to stay." --Margalit Finkelberg, editor of <em>The Homer Encyclopedia</em><p></p><br>"Barry Powell, the master of classical mythology, has done it again--a powerful translation of the poem that started European literature. His muscular verses are faithful to the original Greek but bring the characters to life. This is a page-turner, bound to become the new standard." --Ian Morris, author of <em>Why the West Rules--For Now</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Get Free Cash for College: Secrets to Winning Scholarships</h2><p>The secrets, tips, and strategies used by actual students to win millions of dollars in financial aid and scholarships are revealed in this completely revised guide for parents and high school, college, and graduate students.

He was tall, skinny, and awkward. Looking out at the world through a single knothole, he saw an ugly sight in the mirror: his eye patch. He asked himself: If I was some girl, would I wanna dance with a patch like that there? His scowling reflection shook its head. But then he saw himself smile as he remembered how hard his cousin Rhoda had worked giving him dancing lessons. She had only come up to his waist. He had felt like a big old clumsy buffalo dancing with a graceful deer. After all that effort trying to learn to polka, he wondered if he would actually work up the nerve to ask a girl to polka with him. Maybe he should just ask Rhoda. But it might embarrass her, and who wants to be embarrassed? Besides, she might turn him down. He told his mind: Just shut up! </p><p> When everybody was ready, all dressed up in their Sunday-go-to-meeting clothes even though it wasn't Sunday, the whole family climbed aboard a wagon dragged along by two plodding plow horses. Aunt Orlena was dressed in a long grey dress and grey bonnet. Uncle Isaac wore his baggy black suit, which was beginning to turn brown, and a black string tie. Cousin Jeff had on a black suit, too, newer than his father's, but even baggier, bought with the expectation that he would grow into it someday. Little Rhoda and littler Naomi looked pretty in blue flour-sack dresses and pigtails. Jimmy, who didn't have a suit, was ashamed of his butternut homespun pants and shirt, but he was proud of his new bandanna, which was fire red. </p><p> Jimmy wished the team would pull faster and stir up a little breeze. It was hot on this July night in the middle of Texas. Everybody said this summer was shaping up to be the hottest and driest in memory. Even at this slow pace, the horses were lathered. They had worked hard all day in the field and must be tired. Now that he thought about it, Jimmy figured they had earned the right to plod slowly. </p><p> The wagon followed the road that led to the dreaded Weatherford schoolhouse, but Jimmy didn't mind because school was out for the summer. The closer they got, the more crowded the road grew, the more the little girls giggled, and the more nervous Jimmy became. When the wagon reached the school, the playground, which tonight would double as the dance floor, was already busy and noisy. Children were shouting and laughing, and the fiddles were tuning up. The sun was just setting, making even butternut look almost golden. </p><p> When Jimmy was getting out of the wagon, he tripped on something and almost fell on his face. He hated his own clumsiness. He hated the heavy clodhopper farmer's boots that weighed him down and made his feet feel like heavy hooves. How was he going to be able to dance? He longed for the lightness of his moccasins with the long fringe trailing out behind like a kite's tail. He could dance in those. But they were long -- </p><p> No, Jimmy told himself, don't think about the past. It was too painful. Recalling his lost moccasins would just lead to remembering other losses, unbearable losses. Just think about here and now. But here and now was troubling, too. He couldn't dance. Not really. Not these dances. </p><p> Rhoda and Naomi ran off to be with other little girls. Cousin Jeff slouched off to look for his friends. Aunt Orlena and Uncle Isaac moved off to join the other adults who were busy talking about rainfall and crops. Jimmy kept the plow horses company. He didn't really fit with any group. He wasn't quite a member of the family, wasn't quite white in the eyes of many, wasn't quite right either, was too big for grade school and too dumb for high school. So he talked to the plow horses. </p><p> "O Great Goddogs, thank you for pulling the wagon," Jimmy said softly in the Comanche tongue. "I'm sorry you have to stand here. I know it must be boring, but at least there are two of you. You can keep each other company. There's just one of me." </p><p> Then Jimmy realized that several of the kids had noticed him talking to the horses. They were looking at him funny. Now they really thought he was crazy. He nervously started to put his hands in his pockets, but discovered that they were already there. </p><p> As the air darkened and cooled, Jimmy noticed individuals melting together into dark clumps. He saw girl clumps and boy clumps, big-kid clumps and little-kid clumps, farmer clumps and farmers' wives clumps. Then a clump of musicians started playing a tune, and the other clumps started breaking apart and reforming. </p><p> Drawn by the music, Jimmy moved closer to the musicians: two fiddlers were seated in leaned-back wooden chairs with cowboy hats perched on the backs of their heads. They looked to be in their twenties. A young woman about the same age played an upright piano. Jimmy wondered how she had gotten it from her living room to the playground. An old man probably in his seventies was playing a harmonica. </p><p> Jimmy rocked back and forth to the music, trying to work up the courage to ask somebody to dance. By the light of a full moon -- assisted by several lanterns hung from trees -- he studied the couples on the dirt dance floor. There were teenage couples and middle-age couples and old-age couples. And there were some mixed-age couples -- fathers dancing with daughters, grandmas dancing with grandsons. He tried to comprehend the dance steps, but he just got more and more confused. The swaying couples weren't dancing a polka -- he could tell that much -- but he didn't know what they were dancing. They seemed to move their feet very fast, the same way they had seemed to talk back before he learned to understand them. The dancers were beginning to kick up a good bit of dust, which the orange moon turned into gold dust. It gilded the swaying bodies and made them look like dancing statues. Jimmy thought the dancers looked so pretty that he longed to join them, but longing was as far as he got. Frightened by the strange dance steps, he soon returned to the horses. </p><p> Still, Jimmy's gaze kept reverting again and again to a brown-haired girl in a yellow calico dress which had some sort of design on it. He couldn't quite make out the pattern in the darkness. He had seen her at school, had seen her at services at the Hard-Shell Baptist Church, had nodded to her and even said hello to her a couple of times. Like most of the girls, she was a farmer's daughter, but he thought she was prettier than the others. He remembered that her name was Rachel. </p><p> "Should I ask her to dance?" he asked the horses in the "Human" tongue. "I mean if they ever play a polka." There wasn't a word for "polka" in the Human tongue so he said it in English. "What do you think?" </p><p> One of the horses flicked its tail and shifted its weight from one hind leg to the other. </p><p> "What's that supposed to mean?" he asked. </p><p> Jimmy told himself that he was not a "running-heart." He reminded himself that he had been on the warpath and so should not be afraid of something as harmless as a young girl at a dance. </p><p> The band moved from one tune to another. Listening closely, Jimmy thought he heard a polka. Watching closely, he thought he recognized polka steps being performed on the packed earth. He saw his cousin Jeff dancing what appeared to be a polka with a horse-faced girl. He hated the idea of Jeff being braver than he was, so he started walking. </p><p> As he made his way across the playground, Jimmy tripped again. He blamed his big boots. He blamed his unhappiness. Whatever was to blame, he was not graceful on his feet. He would have to be crazy to ask a pretty girl to dance. But then everybody already thought he was crazy, so what did he have to lose? He just hoped he wouldn't trip on the dance floor and fall on top of her. He reminded himself that he wasn't just awkward but also ugly. His hand went up and touched the patch over his ruined eye. </p><p> And then t</p></p><h2>Successful Writing</h2><p><p><strong>W. W.

These letters, in this four-volume series, also provide a vivid picture of a momentous period in Roman history--years marked by the rise of Julius Caesar and the downfall of the Republic.</p><p>When the correspondence begins in November 68 BCE the 38-year-old Cicero is a notable figure in Rome: a brilliant lawyer and orator, who has achieved primacy at the Roman bar and a political career that would culminate in the Consulship in 63. Over the next twenty-four years--to November 44, a year before he was put to death by the forces of Octavian and Mark Antony--Cicero wrote frequently to his friend and confidant, sharing news and discussing affairs of business and state. It is to this corpus of over 400 letters that we owe most of our information about Cicero's literary activity. And taken as a whole the letters provide a first-hand account of social and political life in Rome.</p></p><p><p>D. R.

This book offers Qian Long&#39;s sage advice on the role of diet, exercise, relaxation, emotions, sex, and environment in achieving long life and good health. This traditional Chinese medical theory includes self-massage, stretching, and qi gong exercise as well as how to use Chinese tonic herbs.</p><p>I wrote this book to try and bring some common sense to the Western arena of health and longevity. Every few months someone discovers a new diet or regimen that is supposed to be the panacea for everyone&#39;s ills. However, Chinese medicine is the oldest, continuously professionally practiced, literate, secular medicine in the world today. The wisdom of Chinese medicine has been honed and tested by more than 100 generations of highly educated professional practitioners. What is called nourishing life or longevity practices have always been a very important aspect of Chinese medicine, and I wanted to present what I have found to be the core essence of those teachings and practices, without undue mysticism or naive romanticism.This book discusses the 14 secrets of longevity of the Qing dynasty emperor, Qian Long, who held one of the longest reigns of any monarch in Chinese history. Qian Long ruled for 60 years and only stepped down from the throne so as not to surpass his grandfather Kang Xi&#39;s 61 year reign. When understood properly, these 14 secrets cover all aspects of a healthy life. Now Western readers can share Qian Long&#39;s pragmatic and common sense wisdom on how to live a long and healthy life. Topics covered include: a regular lifestyle; a healthy, moderate diet; regular rest and exercise; choosing a healthy place to live; pacing one&#39;s sexual activity; self-massage and stretching; special qi gong exercises; using Chinese tonic herbs; and treating disease early and without side effects.</p><h2>A Room in Chelsea Square</h2><p>'[Nelson's] style is swift and straightforward, his narrative gift considerable ...

Nicholas enjoys his luxurious new lifestyle and meeting Patrick's amusing and fashionable friends, but he soon understands what Patrick's really after. Knowing he won't be able to resist the older man's advances forever, the greedy Nicholas will have to choose between his conscience and his newly acquired love of money. <br><br> <i>A Room in Chelsea Square</i> (1958), the semi-autobiographical second novel by Michael Nelson (1921-1990), was published anonymously both because of its frank gay content at a time when homosexuality was still illegal and because its characters were thinly veiled portrayals of prominent London literary figures.

Despite the precise and vivid descriptions of the scenes of battle in his fiction, Stephen Crane was not born until six years after the war had ended and never saw military service. His novel altered the tradition of war literature in its naturalistic emphasis on a single, ordinary man facing the horrors of battle. </p> <p> This edition includes an important new introduction by James Nagel, author of the book <em>Stephen Crane and Literary Impressionism</em> and former president of the Stephen Crane Society. Historically significant reviews and commentary from the publication of the novel in 1895 are included, along with the deleted Chapter 12 from the novel. The short story &#x201c;The Veteran,&#x201d; in which the protagonist appears as an elderly man, is also included. </p></p><p><p> <strong>Stephen Crane</strong> (1871-1900) was an American novelist, poet, and journalist. </p> <p> <strong>James Nagel</strong> is Edson Distinguished Professor Emeritus of English at the University of Georgia. The former President of the Stephen Crane Society, he is the author of <em>Stephen Crane and Literary Impressionism</em> (Pennsylvania State University Press, 1980) and many other books on American literature. </p><p> &#x201c;With this insightful volume, James Nagel once again confirms his stellar reputation as one of the leading critics of American literature. From the engaging discussion of the novel&#x2019;s craftsmanship, its structure and style, to the comprehensive overview of critical perspectives, Nagel&#x2019;s introduction cements <em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> as the finest impressionistic account of the most shattering war in American history. The Appendices are valuable for its evidence of Hamlin Garland&#x2019;s influence on the young writer as well as for the perceptive reviews by Crane&#x2019;s contemporaries. The deleted Chapter 12, reprinted in the appendices, is an essential reference for Nagel&#x2019;s inarguable conclusion that had the chapter remained, the final version of the text would not have achieved such a fine balance of form. Undoubtedly, this edition of America&#x2019;s major Civil War novel will become indispensable to any serious reader of Stephen Crane.&#x201d; &#x2015; Olivia Carr Edenfield, Georgia Southern University </p> <p> &#x201c;James Nagel&#x2019;s edition of Stephen Crane&#x2019;s <em>The Red Badge of Courage</em> is an authoritative, meticulous contribution. In clear, direct prose, Nagel describes the contextual and structural intricacies of the novel and guides readers through the critical tradition. Nagel&#x2019;s annotations are prudent; he does not crowd Crane&#x2019;s text with unnecessary or tangential information. The appendices and select bibliography are also quite valuable, providing researchers an excellent point of departure. Useful to the student as well as the specialist, this book will no doubt become a standard resource for scholars of Crane, Naturalism, and literary Impressionism.&#x201d; &#x2015; Robert C.

She analyzes the link between social class and homosexuality, discusses love between women and the response of women to male homosexuality, and assesses the impact of homosexual relations on heterosexual ones.</p><p>"Cantarella presents the ancient evidence in a straightforward fashion, draws insightful comparisons between heterosexuality and homosexuality, and elucidates the larger cultural context of erotic experience. With its wide scope the book speaks to the classicist, the layman with an interest in antiquity, the student of sexuality, and even the unabashed seeker of piquant anecdotes." &#x2014;John F. Makowski, Classical Journal "An important study that is destined to take its place next to the classic works of Foucault and Pomeroy."&#x2014; Alan Mendelson, History: Reviews of New Books "Offers a valuable, close-in reassessment of intricate evidence, freshly researched, readable, and open- minded."&#x2014;Alan Sinfield, Gay Times "This is a book I recommend for all students of sexology."&#x2014;Milton Diamond, Journal of Psychology &amp; Human Sexuality "Easily the best book on the topic."&#x2014;John Buckler, Historian "A valuable contribution to scholarship about sexual orientation."&#x2014;Richard C.

In this textbook he introduces readers to the range of variation found in tense systems across the languages of the world, bringing together a rich collection of illustrative material that student and specialist alike will find invaluable. This systematic account of the data is carefully integrated with a theoretical discussion of tense that is sensitive both to the range of tense oppositions found cross-linguistically and also to the constraints on that variation. For the most part the book is written without formalism, nor is it written within the framework of any specific current theory of linguistics. Nevertheless, as the final chapter makes clear, a formal theory of tense can build upon the insights gained here. For all readers, Dr Comrie&#39;s coherent and characteristically elegant account of this complex grammatical category will provide a solid basis for further research on tense, even in a language as thoroughly studied as English.</p><p>An introduction to the kinds of tense distinctions made by different languages. Defines tense as the grammatical expression of location in time and attempts to capture the potential range of tense distinctions possible in natural language with examples drawn from a wide range of languages.</p><h2>The Crocodile</h2><p>The Crocodile is a classic Russian short story by Fyodor Dostoevsky. This work by the great Russian bard is an unusual but amusing tale about a man swallowed by a crocodile with a serious message about economics and communism. The story relates the events that befall one Ivan Matveich when he, his wife Elena Ivanovna, and the narrator visit the Arcade to see a crocodile that has been put on display by a German entrepreneur. After teasing the crocodile, Ivan Matveich is swallowed alive. He finds the inside of the crocodile to be quite comfortable, and the animal&#39;s owner refuses to allow it to be cut open, in spite of the pleas from Elena Ivanovna. Ivan Matveich urges the narrator to arrange for the crocodile to be purchased and cut open, but the owner asks so much for it that nothing is done. As the story ends Elena Ivanovna is contemplating divorce and Ivan Matveich resolves to carry on his work as a civil servant as best he can from inside the crocodile. The liberal press declared the story a low parody of the fate of the Russian socialist writer Nikolai Chernyshevsky, who wrote his novel What Is to Be Done? and numerous letters while confined in Peter and Paul Fortress. Dostoyevsky denied that the similarities were intentional.</p><p><b>Fyodor Dostoevsky</b> (1821&#x2013;1881) is considered one of the greatest writers of all time. His works include such seminal novels as <i>Crime and Punishment&nbsp;</i>and<i> The Karamazov Brothers</i>. <b>Guy Daniels</b> published more than 40 translations, from Russian and French into English."Like the discovery of love, like the discovery of the ocean, the discovery of Dostoevsky is a memorable event in our lives."&nbsp; &#x2014;Jorge Luis Borges</p><h2>Boiler operator&#39;s workbook</h2><p>Boiler Operator&#39;s Workbook provides an overview of the latest information on safe and efficient operation of both low- and high-pressure boilers and related equipment.

It gives a nuanced picture of delusion as a repair of language itself, following Freud and Lacan in historic and contemporary forms of psychotic art, writing and speech.</p><p>Annie G. Rogers is Professor of Psychoanalysis and Clinical Psychology at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts, and Co-Director of its Psychoanalytic Studies Program. She is affiliated with the Lacanian School of San Francisco and the Association for Psychoanalysis and Psychotherapy in Ireland. Dr Rogers has a psychoanalytic practice in Amherst, Massachusetts. She is a recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship at Trinity College, Dublin, Ireland; a Radcliffe Fellowship at Harvard University; a Whiting Fellowship at Hampshire College; and an Erikson Scholar at Austen Riggs. Dr Rogers is also the author of <i>A Shining Affliction</i> and <i>The Unsayable</i>, in addition to numerous scholarly articles, short fiction, and poetry.&#39;This extraordinary book about psychosis as an encounter and relationship with language draws the reader in through a narrative that shows us how lacking mainstream psychiatric and psychoanalytic diagnostic categories are. Incandescent Alphabets is an amazing conceptual and poetic alternative that makes of the experience of psychosis an illuminated manuscript from which readers learn about the author, the people she works with, and about themselves.&#39;- Ian Parker, psychoanalyst and author of Psychology after Psychoanalysis: Psychosocial Studies and Beyond&#39;This is a wonderfully written book with a wealth of clinical, literary, and artistic first-person accounts of psychosis that lead the author to an exploration of the meaning and structure of psychosis as a significantly human form of subjectivity.&#39;- Raul Moncayo, psychoanalyst, the Lacanian School of Psychoanalysis of the San Francisco Bay Area, and author of The Signifier Pointing at the Moon: Psychoanalysis and Zen Buddhism&#39;This prism-like account of psychosis filters first-hand accounts of psychotic experience through the lens of Lacanian psychoanalysis and produces one of the most readable and important texts of our generation. Annie Rogers depathologises psychosis by showing that it is not a deficit or a failure but is a different relationship to language, the body and the social world. Her deeply personal and humanising account shows that it is our fears, inexperience and unwillingness to collaborate together that erect barriers to living and working with the myriad vicissitudes and possibilities of psychosis.&#39;- Eve Watson, PhD, psychoanalyst, Dublin&#39;This exciting compendium is an ABC of psychosis, from Artaud to Yessir. Her gallery of portraits includes self-taught or outsider artists as well as recognisable figures like Joyce, Walser, and Woolf. Skilfully blending research, insight, stories, literary and visual arts examples, Rogers offers a compelling, empathetic narrative. This engrossing book, beautifully written, is not only an illuminating read, but also a poetic meditation on the variegated forms taken by madness.&#39;- Patricia Gherovici, psychoanalyst, author, and co-editor of Lacan on Madness: Madness, Yes You Can&#39;t</p><h2>Digital Systems: Principles and Applications (11th Edition)</h2><p>For an introduction to digital systems in two- and four-year programs in technology, engineering, and computer science.

The many times and tongues in these poems investigate the precariousness of personhood in lines that excoriate and sanctify. Carmen Gim�nez Smith turns the increasingly pressing urge to cry out into a dream of rebellion&#x2015;against compromise, against inertia, against self-delusion, and against the ways the media dream up our complacency in an America that depends on it. This reckoning with self and nation demonstrates that who and where we are is as conditional as the fact of our compliance: &#x201c;Miss America from sea to shining sea / the huddled masses have a question / there is one of you and all of us.&#x201d; <i>Be Recorder</i> is unrepentant and unstoppable, and affirms Gim�nez Smith as one of the most vital and vivacious poets of our time.</p></p><p><b>Carmen Gim�nez Smith</b> is the author of six books, including <i>Milk and Filth</i>, a finalist for the National Book Critics Circle Award in poetry, and <i>Bring Down the Little Birds</i>, winner of the American Book Award.

The book argues that international organizations sometimes cause more conflict than they avert in their rush to establish democratic governments and punish outgoing leaders. Snyder closes by prescribing policies that can make democratic transitions less dangerous and allow fledgling democracies to flourish.</p><p>Jack L. Snyder is the Robert and Renee Belfer Professor of International Relations in the Department of Political Science and the Saltzman Institute of War and Peace Studies at Columbia University. He holds a Ph.D. from Columbia. His books include Electing to Fight: Why Emerging Democracies Go to War, coauthored with Edward D. Mansfield (MIT Press, 2007) and From Voting to Violence: Democratization and Nationalist Conflict (W.W. Norton, 2000). His articles on such topics as crisis diplomacy, democratization and war, nationalism, imperial overstretch, war crimes tribunals versus amnesties, international relations theory after September 11, and anarchy and culture have appeared in Foreign Affairs, Foreign Policy, International Organization, International Security, and World Politics. Professor Snyder teaches graduate and undergraduate courses on nationalism, comparative methods, and grand strategy. Professor Snyder is a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences and an elected member of Columbia&#39;s Arts and Sciences Policy and Planning Committee. He is the editor of the Norton Series in World Politics.In this acutely argued book, Columbia University political scientist Snyder challenges the American dogma that voting is a political panacea regardless of conditions or circumstances. Critically assessing American foreign policy in the 1990s, he argues that promoting free elections often produces serious conflict; he argues that where critical preconditions are not present (where there isn't, for instance, an adaptable ruling elite or institutions such as the rule of law and a free press), embracing the popular ballot often leads to the rise of a noxious nationalism, conflict and war: "Democratization produces nationalism when powerful elites within a nation need to harness popular energies to the tasks of war and economic development" yet "want to avoid surrendering real political authority." Snyder supports his theory with overwhelming evidence from a diverse array of historical situations--from revolutionary France to Nazi Germany, from Eastern Europe after the breakup of the Soviet Union to central Africa and central and southern Asia. His documentation suggests a pattern in ethnically divided authoritarian states: ethnic/nationalist conflict often bursts out just as efforts at democratization get underway. Drawing on his analysis, Snyder "prescribes ways to make democratic transitions less dangerous." The intellectual rigor of this important book distinguishes it from arguments driven by simple conservative longings for authoritarian rule; his analysis of the link between the initiation of democracy and resulting nationalism is far more convincing than the common reference to "ancient hatreds" as the source of conflict. Exceptionally well-organized and clearly written, Snyder's book provides a fresh look at the debate over the process of introducing democracy into formerly authoritarian countries.

Maroon and the pen of Tom Wicker sheds light on Nixon and this extraordinary and unsettling time.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;Fred Maroon had no way of knowing when he began work on a book project to photograph the new presidency that he would find himself in a unique position to document the events, as they unraveled, of the Watergate crisis. At that time no other outside photographer had been given the kind of access Maroon had to the White House or, later, to the Committee to Re-elect the President. To complete the story of Watergate, Maroon covered the events that followed - the Senate Watergate hearings, the House impeachment hearings, and the final days of the Nixon presidency.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;Most of the 145 duotone photographs in this remarkable portfolio have never been published before; they are the best of the thousands of pictures Maroon took during Nixon&#39;s term of office, from his jubilant inauguration in 1969 to his emotional resignation in 1974. The pictures are direct, powerful documents of a disturbing political era.&#34;--BOOK JACKET. &#34;The accompanying text by eminent journalist Tom Wicker, who also had first-hand knowledge of the presidency as a columnist for the New York Times, is an objective, insightful narration of the Nixon years.&#34;--BOOK JACKET.</p><p>Maroon, a freelance photographer who has covered Washington for nearly 50 years, here presents a record of 145 black-and-white photographs showing the Nixon years from the President's triumphant inauguration in 1969 to his anguished, dispirited resignation in August 1974. This volume accompanies Maroon's exhibition, which appeared during 1999 at the Smithsonian Museum of American History. Wicker, former Washington bureau chief for the New York Times and author of the sympathetic One of Us: Richard Nixon and the American Dream, provides a brief narrative about the Nixon years and the lasting destructive Watergate legacy. The uniformly excellent photographs provide a visual account of the always formal Nixon staff but also include many distinctive shots, such as Richard and Pat Nixon relaxing on the beach at San Clemente; a smirking, arrogant Jeb Magruder, deputy director of the Committee to Re-Elect the President, before pleading guilty to obstruction of justice; and John Lennon and Yoko Ono watching the Senate Watergate hearings. Augmenting the pictures are often humorous, gossipy anecdotes about Maroon's famous and notorious subjects. The pictures express troubled emotions more effectively than words: recommended for public libraries.AKarl Helicher, Upper Merion Twp.

In this groundbreaking book, John Sides and Lynn Vavreck tell the dramatic story of the election&#x2015;with a big difference. Using an unusual "moneyball" approach and drawing on extensive quantitative data, they look beyond the anecdote, folklore, and conventional wisdom that often pass for election analysis to separate what was truly important from what was irrelevant. <i>The Gamble</i> combines this data with the best social science research and colorful on-the-ground reporting, providing the most accurate and precise account of the election yet written&#x2015;and the only book of its kind.</p><p>In a new preface, the authors reflect on the place of <i>The Gamble</i> in the tradition of presidential election studies, its reception to date, and possible paths for future social science research.</p></p><p><p>"Conventional campaign books portray a fantasy world shaped by brilliant strategists and dramatic events.

A close friend of Andre Breton, Joan Miro, and Max Ernst, he joined the Surrealist movement in the early 20s, then disassociated with it in the early 30s, focusing instead on the human condition - the fundamental impulses of love and hatred - and reacting to the Spanish Civil War. In the early 40s, Masson moved to America and became interested in mythical imagery. Many of his paintings from this period show a focus on African American and Native American myths, and the style of his expression and brushwork influenced many young American painters.<br>This survey presents the full range of Masson's work, from his Surrealist period to the later, more mythical subjects. Dawn Ades's text provides an authoritative and thoughtful introduction to the ideas behind Masson's work.</p><p></p><h2>The Cambridge World History of Food (2-Volume Set)</h2><p>An undertaking without parallel or precedent, this monumental two-volume work encapsulates much of what is known of the history of food and nutrition throughout the span of human life on earth. It constitutes a vast and essential chapter in the history of human health and culture. Ranging from the eating habits of our prehistoric ancestors to food-related policy issues we face today, this work covers the full spectrum of foods that have been hunted, gathered, cultivated, and domesticated; their nutritional makeup and uses; and their impact on cultures and demography. It offers a geographical perspective on the history and culture of food and drink and takes up subjects from food fads, prejudices, and taboos to questions of food toxins, additives, labeling, and entitlements. It culminates in a dictionary that identifies and sketches out brief histories of plant foods mentioned in the text--over 1,000 in all--and additionally supplies thousands of common names and synonyms for those foods. The essays in this volume are the work of 220 experts in fifteen countries, in fields from agronomy to zoology. Every chapter is accompanied by bibliographical references. The volumes are organized in the following sections: 1. A determination of what our Paleolithic ancestors ate during their stay on the planet (over 99 percent of the time humankind has lived on earth). 6 chapters 2. An extensive treatment of the domestication and development of each of humankind&#39;s staple foods. 60 chapters 3. The history of our dietary liquids from beer through soft drinks to water. 13 chapters 4. Studies on the discovery of vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and the essential fatty acids along with a look at what they do for us. 37 chapters 5. A history of food and drink for all of the countries in the world. In addition there is a chapter on culinary history. 23 chapters 6. Historical issues involving human health, such as nutrition and mortality decline, height and nutrition, infection and nutrition. 18 chapters 7. Contemporary food-related policy issues are treated in this penultimate section of the work. Examples include chapters on food labeling, food biotechnology and the RDAs. 13 chapters 8. The last section of the work is a food-plant dictionary with over 1,000 entries that emphasize history and usage. The dictionary also includes over 4,000 synonyms for the names of plant food. Here readers well-informed about potatoes or asparagus can learn about lesser-known or strictly regional foods such as ackee or zamia and--among the thousands of synonyms provided--can discover that an aubergine is an eggplant, that &#34;swedes&#34; are rutabagas, and that &#34;bulgar&#34; comes from bulghur, which means &#34;bruised grain.&#34;</p><p>Have the French always enjoyed their renowned cuisine? When did Russians begin to eat pirogi? What was the first Indonesian spice to be cultivated elsewhere in the world? Questions such as these make for good <i>Jeopardy</i> material, but they're far from trivial--just ask anyone with a passion for good food and a curiosity for where that food originated. That person will know instinctively that the best way to approach a culture--and, indeed, the human animal--is through the stomach. For this individual, <i>The Cambridge World History of Food</i> will be something of a bible, and the best of gifts. <p> A massive scholarly tome in two volumes and more than 2,000 pages, the <i>CWHF</i> encompasses a wealth of learning that touches on nearly every aspect of human life. (It also reveals the answers to the three earlier questions: No, French cuisine as we know it is a 19th-century development; in the 16th century, following the conquest of the Volga Tatar; ginger, in colonial Mexico.) Thoroughly researched and highly accessible despite its formidable layout, the set addresses a groaning board of topics past and present, from the diet of prehistoric humans to the role of iron in combating disease; from the domestication of animals to the spread of once-isolated ethnic cuisines in a fast-globalizing world. Of greatest interest to general readers is its concluding section--a dictionary of the world's food plants, which gives brief accounts of items both common and exotic, from abalong to Zuttano avocado. </p><p> The product of seven years of research, writing, and editing on the part of more than 200 authors, <i>The Cambridge World History of Food</i> promises to become a standard reference for social scientists, economists, nutritionists, and other scholars--and for cooks and diners seeking to deepen their knowledge of the materials they use and consume. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>An undertaking without parallel or precedent, this monumental two-volume work encapsulates the history of food and nutrition throughout the span of human life on earth.

This book is the first comprehensive and up-to-date account of the earliest stages of vinicultural history and prehistory, which extends back into the Neolithic period and beyond. Elegantly written and richly illustrated, <i>Ancient Wine</i> opens up whole new chapters in the fascinating story of wine and the vine by drawing upon recent archaeological discoveries, molecular and DNA sleuthing, and the texts and art of long-forgotten peoples.</p><br><p> Patrick McGovern takes us on a personal odyssey back to the beginnings of this consequential beverage when early hominids probably enjoyed a wild grape wine. We follow the course of human ingenuity in domesticating the Eurasian vine and learning how to make and preserve wine some 7,000 years ago. Early winemakers must have marveled at the seemingly miraculous process of fermentation. From success to success, viniculture stretched out its tentacles and entwined itself with one culture after another (whether Egyptian, Iranian, Israelite, or Greek) and laid the foundation for civilization itself. As medicine, social lubricant, mind-altering substance, and highly valued commodity, wine became the focus of religious cults, pharmacopoeias, cuisines, economies, and society. As an evocative symbol of blood, it was used in temple ceremonies and occupies the heart of the Eucharist. Kings celebrated their victories with wine and made certain that they had plenty for the afterlife. (Among the colorful examples in the book is McGovern's famous chemical reconstruction of the funerary feast--and mixed beverage--of "King Midas.") Some peoples truly became "wine cultures.?</p><br><p> When we sip a glass of wine today, we recapitulate this dynamic history in which a single grape species was harnessed to yield an almost infinite range of tastes and bouquets. <i>Ancient Wine</i> is a book that wine lovers and archaeological sleuths alike will raise their glasses to.</p></p><p><p>"I raise my glass to Patrick McGovern, who mixes authoritative knowledge of ancient viniculture with inspired writing into a heady drink for the mind.

Are there genetic explanations for racial differences in test scores? What makes some nationalities excel in engineering and others in music? Will math and science remain a largely male preserve. From the damning research of <em>The Bell Curve</em> to the more recent controversy surrounding geneticist James Watson's statements, one factor has been consistently left out of the equation: culture. In the tradition of <em>The Mismeasure of Man</em> by Stephen Jay Gould, world-class social psychologist Richard E. Nisbett takes on the idea of intelligence as something that is biologically determined and impervious to culture--with vast implications for the role of education as it relates to social and economic development. <em>Intelligence and How to Get It</em> asserts that intellect is not primarily genetic but is principally determined by societal influences. Nisbett's commanding argument, superb marshaling of evidence, and fearless discussions of the controversial carve out new and exciting terrain in this hotly debated field.</p><p>Richard E.

This anthology of tales by Rudyard Kipling contains some of the most memorable and popular examples of the genre of which he is an undisputed master. The Man Who would be King (later adapted as a spectacular film) is a vivid narrative of exotic adventure and disaster. The other tales include the ironic, horrific, poignant and haunting. Here Kipling displays his descriptive panache and realistic boldness. Shrewd, audacious, abrasive and challenging, he remains absorbingly readable.COMPLETE AND UNABRIDGED</p><p>&#39;The Man Who Would be King&#39; is the story of two British vagabonds who set off to establish a small kingdom among primitive tribesmen in Afghanistan. Only one of the men returns, and his condition is so bad that the newspaperman-narrator barely recognizes him.This collection brings together seventeen of Kipling&#39;s early stories, written between 1885 and 1888, when Kipling was working as a journalist in India. The stories include: &#39;The Phantom Rickshaw, &#39; &#39;Baa Baa, Black Sheep, &#39; &#39;At the Pit&#39;s Mouth, &#39; &#39;A Wayside Comedy, &#39; &#39;Gemini, &#39; &#39;The Strange Ride of Morrowbie Jukes, &#39; &#39;At Twenty-Two, &#39; and &#39;With the Main Guard.&#39;Audiobook read by Fred Williams.Rudyard Kipling was a famous British author who wrote about 19th century India.</p><h2>Adapting Minds: Evolutionary Psychology and the Persistent Quest for Human Nature (Bradford Books)</h2><p>Was human nature designed by natural selection in the Pleistocene epoch? The dominant view in evolutionary psychology holds that it was&#x2014;that our psychological adaptations were designed tens of thousands of years ago to solve problems faced by our hunter-gatherer ancestors. In this provocative and lively book, David Buller examines in detail the major claims of evolutionary psychology&#x2014;the paradigm popularized by Steven Pinker in <i>The Blank Slate</i> and by David Buss in <i>The Evolution of Desire</i>&#x2014;and rejects them all. This does not mean that we cannot apply evolutionary theory to human psychology, says Buller, but that the conventional wisdom in evolutionary psychology is misguided.<br> <br> Evolutionary psychology employs a kind of reverse engineering to explain the evolved design of the mind, figuring out the adaptive problems our ancestors faced and then inferring the psychological adaptations that evolved to solve them. In the carefully argued central chapters of <i>Adapting Minds</i>, Buller scrutinizes several of evolutionary psychology's most highly publicized "discoveries," including "discriminative parental solicitude" (the idea that stepparents abuse their stepchildren at a higher rate than genetic parents abuse their biological children). Drawing on a wide range of empirical research, including his own large-scale study of child abuse, he shows that none is actually supported by the evidence.<br> <br> Buller argues that our minds are not adapted to the Pleistocene, but, like the immune system, are continually adapting, over both evolutionary time and individual lifetimes. We must move beyond the reigning orthodoxy of evolutionary psychology to reach an accurate understanding of how human psychology is influenced by evolution. When we do, Buller claims, we will abandon not only the quest for human nature but the very idea of human nature itself.</p><p>"David Buller's searching critique of evolutionary psychology is intended to make the field stronger. He shows how much philosophy can contribute to an intense and ongoing scientific debate." <br>--David Sloan Wilson, Binghamton University, author of Darwin's Cathedral: Evolution, Religion, and the Nature of Society <p>"Buller's critique of evolutionary psychology is measured, logical, and clearly developed. It is also devastating. Buller does not seek to refute the entirety of evolutionary psychology by finding a single magic bullet. Rather, he attends to the details, finding a variety of serious problems in the different arguments that evolutionary psychologists deploy. This is philosophy of science in the trenches, and it is excellent." <br>--Elliott Sober, Hans Reichenbach Professor and William Vilas Research Professor, University of Wisconsin, Madison </p><p>"How do you tell the difference between evolutionary psychology as popular culture and as science? Buller solves the problem. He disentangles convictions born of everyday intuition from the thinking and evidence that are necessary for a scientific understanding of human cognition and behavior in an evolutionary perspective. In clear and accessible prose, he delivers a much-needed analysis of current theory and research claiming to unlock human nature. This book is essential for evolutionary psychologists, their critics, and hungry audiences." <br>--Linnda R. Caporael, Professor of Science and Technology Studies, Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute </p><p>"This is a superb book, wonderfully clear in thought and expression. The evolutionary psychology program represented by Pinker, Cosmides, and their allies has already been the target of impressive theoretical discussion, but this has focused mostly on the assumptions they make about evolutionary theory and human paleobiology. Buller covers this material with exemplary clarity, but the real strength of his work lies in his searching critique of the experimental case for evolutionary psychology. His is by far the best treatment of these issues I have ever read. In case after case, Buller shows that the experimental case for the existence of Darwinian algorithms is much weaker than even skeptics like me have supposed." <br>--Kim Sterelny, Victoria University of Wellington, New Zealand, and Australian National University</p>David J.

A conservative Republican legislator in Colorado when asked to join Reagan's transition team in 1980, Burford portrays herself as an EPA head who favored enforcement of environmental laws and sought to make a bloated, backlogged agency "efficient and effective." During 22 controversial months in office, however, she found herself hampered constantly by what she considers unfair news media, environmental "extremists" and Machiavellian maneuvering by White House staffers. Burford covers at length the Rita Lavelle controversy and the complex events (centering on her refusal to give documents to Congress) leading to her own forced resignation. She concludes by charging that Reagan, a longtime political hero, "doesn't care about the environment." Photos not seen by PW. December 16<br>Copyright 1985 Reed Business Information, Inc.The controversial former EPA administrator of the early Reagan years has produced an insider apologia with little but criticism for members of the White House staff such as James Baker and David Stockman, or for Edwin Meese, among others, in the Justice Department. Likewise, Burford recounts with evident anger the problems she encountered with ``pack journalism'' and the insensitivity of the ``liberal'' press (which evidently included all of those who covered her) for its disregard for the privacy of its ``victims'' (those reported upon). She spends quite a bit of time defending her actions, sometimes through quotations from documents and other times via accounts of conversations with subordinates such as Rita Lavelle. Even President Reagan is viewed as a well-meaning but bumbling captive of his staff. Of some interest as part of the historical record.

The central premise is that critical discourse analysis must be conducted "systematically," which means conducting inquiry into the ways in which language form and function correlate with social practices. Bringing together the work of New Literacy Studies, situated literacy, critical discourse theory and analysis with theories of learning, the text is distinctive in providing not just useful analytic accounts of discourse in classroom and other settings, but going on to identify ways in which these forms of language are connected to theories of learning.<br>Contributions from two pioneers in the field--James Gee and Norman Fairclough--are combined with empirically grounded chapters that illustrate variations of their approaches to critical discourse analysis. Each chapter presents examples of systematical critical discourse analysis and its relevance in education settings, and provides detailed information on analytic procedures. <br> <br> <i>An Introduction to Critical Discourse Analysis in Education:</i><br> <br>*introduces key concepts in critical discourse analysis and answers some of the frequently asked questions;<br> <br>*situates critical discourse analysis within educational research; and<br> <br>*provides detailed analytic procedures, to demystify the process, allow researchers to have a conversation about issues of trustworthiness of interpretations and value to educational contexts, and enable replication of studies.<br>The new synthesis of theoretical and empirical studies in critical discourse analysis and education the book presents will interest newcomers to critical discourse analysis, as well as researchers and educators interested in discourse, identity, and learning. The descriptive, critical ethnographic and interpretive approaches to critical discourse analysis developed in each chapter make the book accessible yet theoretically rich. Pedagogical features make critical discourse analysis accessible to students. The text is cross-disciplinary, intended for courses in qualitative methodology, discourse analysis, critical discourse studies, and literacy education. It will appeal not only to education researchers but to a wide readership within literacy studies, linguistics, sociology, and other social sciences concerned with contemporary approaches to describing and explaining the role of language in learning and education.<br></p><p><p><strong>Rebecca Rogers</strong> is Associate Professor of Literacy Studies in the College of Education at the University of Missouri-St. Louis.</p><p><i>...may be of interest to second language teachers interested in employing discourse analysis as a means of describing social relations and&nbsp;empowerment issues in the classroom.</i><br>&#x2014;<b><i>Modern Language Journal</i></b></p><p><i>...Roger's introduction covers a lot of useful territory....it is good to see that nearly all of the authors in the volume, from diverse academic backgrounds, are educators.</i><br>&#x2014;<b><i>Language in Society</i></b></p><p><i>...draws upon a range of current sociocultural theories of learning and approaches to critical discourse analysis, and advances both fields by generating new understandings of the relationships among language form and function, social practices, learning, identity, and social change.</i><br>&#x2014;<b>Judith W.

It is a foundational and ground-breaking book in its attempt to lay out a sustained and rigorous account of place and its significance.</p> <p></p> <p>The main argument of <i>Place and Experience</i> has three strands: first, that human being is inextricably bound to place; second, that place encompasses subjectivity and objectivity, being reducible to neither but foundational to both; and third that place, which is distinct from, but also related to space and time, is methodologically and ontologically fundamental. The development of this argument involves considerations concerning the nature of place and its relation to space and time; the character of that mode of philosophical investigation that is oriented to place and that is referred to as &#x2018;philosophical topography&#x2019;; the nature of subjectivity and objectivity as inter-related concepts that also connect with intersubjectivity; and the way place is tied to memory, identity, and the self. Malpas draws on a rich array of writers and philosophers, including Wordsworth, Kant, Proust, Heidegger and Donald Davidson.</p> <p>This second edition is revised throughout, including a new chapter on place and technological modernity, especially the seeming loss of place in the contemporary world, and a new Foreword by Edward Casey. It also includes a new set of additional features, such as illustrations, annotated further reading, and a glossary, which make this second edition more useful to teachers and students alike.</p></p><p>While the &#39;sense of place&#39; is a familiar theme in poetry and art, philosophers have generally given little or no attention to place and the human relation to place. Jeff Malpas seeks to remedy this by advancing an account of the nature and significance of place as a complex but unitary structure that encompasses self and other, space and time, subjectivity and objectivity. He argues that our relation to place derives from the very nature of human thought, experience and identity as established in and through place.<b> </b><p><b>Jeff Malpas</b> is Distinguished Professor at the University of Tasmania, Australia.

This book presents with nine of his speeches that reflect the development, variety, and drama of his political career. Among them are two speeches from his prosecution of Verres, a corrupt and cruel governor of Sicily; four speeches against the conspirator Catiline; and the <em>Second Philippic</em>, the famous denunciation of Mark Antony, which cost Cicero his life. Also included are <em>On the Command of Gnaeus Pompeius</em>, in which he praises the military successes of Pompey, and <em>For Marcellus</em>, a panegyric in praise of the dictator Julius Caesar. <br> These new translations preserve Cicero's oratorical brilliance and achieve new standards of accuracy. A general introduction outlines Cicero's public career, and separate introductions explain the political significance of each of the speeches. This edition also provides an up-to-date scholarly bibliography, glossary and two maps. Together with the companion volume of <em>Defense Speeches</em>, this edition provides an unparalleled sampling of Cicero's achievements. <br></p><p>Marcus Tullius Cicero (106 BC-43 BC) was an orator, statesman, political theorist, and philosopher of Ancient Rome.

Set in a town not unlike the Hannibal of Twain's youth, the book began life as a slapstick comedy about Siamese twins. But "it changed from a farce to a tragedy," Twain tells us, in the course of his writing, and the result was one of the most profound meditations on race and identity an American writer has produced. The voice that dominates this tale is that of Roxana, a light-skinned slave desperate to keep her child from being sold down the river, who switches him in the cradle with the child of her master. Roxana, Twain's most complex and fully-realized adult female character, is a compelling tragic heroine; the plot she sets in motion is daring, risky, and totally riveting. Murder and mayhem precede a courtroom scene that ranks as one of the most memorable in American literature. This conflicted, provocative, richly satirical novel confronts head-on the enigma of what makes us who we are.</p><p>Featuring the brilliantly drawn Roxanna, a mulatto slave who suffers dire consequences after switching her infant son with her master's baby, and the clever Pudd'nhead Wilson, an ostracized small-town lawyer, Twain's darkly comic masterpiece is a provocative exploration of slavery and miscegenation. Leslie A. Fiedler described the novel as "half melodramatic detective story, half bleak tragedy," noting that "morally, it is one of the most honest books in our literature."

The collection begins with a series of chapters offering truly global visions; they range from reflections on the role of animals in environmental history to an overview of environmental change over the past ten millennia. </p> <p>Part Two switches to a sharper focus, featuring essays that characterize the distinctiveness of certain key regions such as China, Russia, West Africa, South Asia, Europe, and Latin America. The final part of the book examines different forms of modern environmentalism, ranging from the U.S. and its fascination with wilderness, to Japanese concern with human health, and on to Peru and India, where the environmental debate centres on access to resources. </p> <p><em>Global Environmental History</em> will be an essential resource for students of Environmental History and Global History. </p></p><p><p><strong>John R.

Together they explore many of the key themes in the emerging interdisciplinary field of environmental history, which explores past relations between people and environments historically, geographically, ecologically and through following many other disciplinary paths as well. The &#x2018;global synthesis&#x2019; will ultimately need the understandings of many scales &#x2013; global, regional and local &#x2013; and the readings are organised in a way that considers the insights from each.

This is the first book designed for university and high school teachers who want to integrate queer history into the standard curriculum. With its inspiring stories, classroom-tested advice, and rich information, it is a valuable resource for anyone who thinks history should be an all-inclusive story.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Understanding and Teaching U.S. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History</i> offers a wealth of insight for teachers.

Freeman make clear why queer history is important and provide global historical context, showing that same-sex sexual desire and gender change are not new, modern phenomena. Teachers in diverse educational settings provide narratives of their experiences teaching queer history. A topical section offers seventeen essays on such themes as sexual diversity in early America, industrial capitalism and emergent sexual cultures, and gay men and lesbians in World War II. Contributors include detailed suggestions for integrating these topics into a standard U.S. history curriculum, including creative and effective assignments. A final section addresses sources and interpretive strategies well-suited to the history classroom.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Taken as a whole,<i> Understanding and Teaching U.S. Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender History</i> will help teachers at all levels navigate through cultural touchstones and political debates and provide a fuller knowledge of significant events in history.<br><br> &#x201c;A terrific book for anyone teaching U.S. history to high school or college students.

This new molecule, one of a large family of carbon cage molecules called &#34;fullerenes&#34;--represents a new form of carbon, complementing such well-known materials as diamond and graphite. Its discovery has revolutionized our understanding of carbon, once the most familiar elements. It has heralded a new chemistry, a new range of high-temperature superconductors and some marvelous new concepts in the architecture of large carbon structures. In this account, prize-winning science writer Jim Baggott tells the compelling story of buckminsterfullerene, from its natural occurrence in the cold chemistry of interstellar clouds to its accidental, stunning creation in a modern chemistry laboratory, and the subsequent development of one of today&#39;s fastest-growing scientific fields. By combining a lucid and entertaining style with scientific accuracy, the author has written a book that will appeal to general readers and chemists alike.</p><p><br>"Provides an overview of the state of the field that is as well informed and as up to date as one could wish.... Lavishly illustrated, largely with figures from the original sources.... Very well written and rewarding.

With appropriate diagnosis and treatment, coma can often be treated successfully. Conversely, delay in diagnosis and treatment may be lethal. This monograph provides an update on the clinical approach that was laid out in the previous 3 editions. It describes an approach for the physician at the bedside to diagnose and treat alterations of consciousness, based on pathophysiologic principles. The book begins with a description of the physiology of consciousness and the pathophysiology of disorders of consciousness. It continues with a description of the approach to a patient with a disorder of consciousness, emphasizing the bedside examination, but including the use of modern imaging techniques. The important structural and metabolic causes of coma are reviewed in detail. It then describes the emergency treatment, both medical and surgical, of patients with specific disorders of consciousness and their prognosis.

Max had traveled to Paris after the end of the Great War to investigate the suspicious death of his diplomat father, Sir Henry Maxted, and was soon plunged into a treacherous game of cat and mouse with the people behind the murder: German spymaster Fritz Lemmer and the dark horse of the Japanese diplomatic contingent, Count Tomura.

Rousmaniere depicts how New York City teachers experienced citywide reform initiatives in their already stressful workday, and how they resisted, undermined, and adapted school reform policy. Drawing on extensive interviews with teachers of an earlier generation, Rousmaniere lets readers see the complexity of teachers&#x2019; work, their problems with reform implementation, and the conditions they believed were necessary for real change. This is an important book because it raises questions about teachers&#x2019; historical work culture and the effects of teachers&#x2019; working conditions.

To be human is, in part, to be physically sexed and culturally gendered. Yet not all bodies are clearly male or female. <i>Bodies in Doubt</i> traces the changing definitions, perceptions, and medical management of intersex (atypical sex development) in America from the colonial period to the present day. </p><p>From the beginning, intersex bodies have been marked as "other," as monstrous, sinister, threatening, inferior, and unfortunate. Some nineteenth-century doctors viewed their intersex patients with disrespect and suspicion. Later, doctors showed more empathy for their patients' plights and tried to make correct decisions regarding their care. Yet definitions of "correct" in matters of intersex were entangled with shifting ideas and tensions about what was natural and normal, indeed about what constituted personhood or humanity.</p><p>Reis has examined hundreds of cases of "hermaphroditism" and intersex found in medical and popular literature and argues that medical practice cannot be understood outside of the broader cultural context in which it is embedded. As the history of responses to intersex bodies has shown, doctors are influenced by social concerns about marriage and heterosexuality. <i>Bodies in Doubt</i> considers how Americans have interpreted and handled ambiguous bodies, how the criteria and the authority for judging bodies changed, how both the binary gender ideal and the anxiety over uncertainty persisted, and how the process for defining the very norms of sex and gender evolved.</p><p><i>Bodies in Doubt</i> breaks new ground in examining the historical roots of modern attitudes about intersex in the United States and will interest scholars and researchers in disability studies, social history, gender studies, and the history of medicine.</p></p><p><p><i>Bodies in Doubt </i>traces the changing definitions, perceptions, and medical management of intersex (atypical sexual development) in America from the colonial period to the present day.

Now, in a new book that is sure to stir controversy, one of the world's leading evolutionary biologists shows why most of those claims of genetic destiny cannot be true, and explains how the arguments often stem from a fundamental misunderstanding of evolution itself. "You can't change human nature," the saying goes. But you can, Stanford biologist Paul Ehrlich shows us in <i>Human Natures</i>, and in fact, evolution is the story of those changing natures. He makes a compelling case that "human nature" is not a single, unitary entity, but is as diverse as humanity itself, and that changes in culture and other environmental variations play as much of a role in human evolution as genetic changes. We simply don't have enough genes to specify behavior at the level that is often asserted. Never has knowledge of our evolutionary past been more important to our future. Developing intelligent strategies for antibiotic use, pest control, biodiversity protection -- and even for establishing more equitable social arrangements -- all depend on understanding evolution and how it works. A hallmark of <i>Human Natures</i> is the author's ability to convey lucidly that understanding in the course of presenting an engrossing history of our species. Using personal anecdote, vivid example, and stimulating narrative, Ehrlich guides us through the thicket of controversies over what science can and cannot say about the influence of our evolutionary past on everything from race to religion, from sexual orientation to economic development. A major work of synthesis and scholarship, <i>Human Natures</i> gives us the fruit of a lifetime's thought and research on evolution and environment by a modern master of scientific understanding. Ehrlich's innovative vision lights the way to a fresh view of human nature and evolution, bringing insight and clarity to urgent questions of where we are as a species, and where we may be headed.</p><p>It's common to blame "human nature" for some of the unpleasant facts of life--road rage, say, or murder, or war. The problem with this convenient out, argues the distinguished scientist Paul Ehrlich, is that there really is no single human nature. Humans, it's true, share a common genetic code with remarkably few large-scale differences (if all but native Africans disappeared from the planet, he notes, "humanity would still retain somewhat more than 90 percent of its genetic variability"); and evolution has endowed us with capabilities shared by no other species. But for all that, he adds, our separation into haves and have-nots, weak and strong, and other such categories is more often than not a product of cultural evolution, a process far more complex than the mere mutation and adaptation of a few genes. And, in any event, those genes "do not shout commands to us about our behavior," Ehrlich says. "At the very most, they whisper suggestions."<p> In this wide-ranging survey of what it is that has made and that continues to make us human, Ehrlich touches on a number of themes--among them, his recurrent observation that science has taught us little about how genes influence human behavior. (Instead, he notes wryly, "science tells us that we are creatures of accident clinging to a ball of mud hurtling aimlessly through space. This is not a notion to warm hearts or rouse multitudes.") He urges that scientists take a larger, interdisciplinary view that looks beyond mere genetics to the larger forces that shape our lives, a view for which <i>Human Natures</i> makes a handy, and highly accessible, primer. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Paul R. Ehrlich is a co-founder with Peter H. Raven of the field of co-evolution, and has pursued long-term studies of the structure, dynamics, and genetics of natural butterfly populations. He has also been a pioneer in alerting the public to the problems of overpopulation, and in raising issues of population, resources, and the environment as matters of public policy. Ehrlich is the author of <i>The Population Bomb</i>, and many other books, as well as hundreds of papers. <br>&nbsp;<br>Ehrlich is a fellow of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society, and a member of the National Academy of Sciences.

Such is the case with Soviet art of the 1930s to 1980s, which is now considered the twentieth century's major realist school of painting. Yet, during its heyday, and thanks to the politics of the Cold War and the shortsightedness of western critics, the treasures of Soviet artists of the period remained hidden, often, if not politically correct, languishing for years in artists' studios.<br>Vern Swanson has given us a book illustrated with 176 colour plates, accompanied by an account of the tradition of painting for a proletarian society - 'art for the masses' - and how this developed into a full-blown form of Working-class Impressionism. The message was dictated by the policy-makers: the art should be readily understood and appreciated by the people, reflecting their hopes and aspirations for themselves and their efforts. The subject matter is the intimate life of the Soviet man, woman and child - at work in school, field, factory and mine, and at home and play.</p><p></p><h2>Charles Webster Hawthorne: Paintings and Watercolors</h2><p>This is the first life comprehensive book on the life and work of the most outstanding American realists of the early 20th century.

Influenced by the Old Masters -- especially Titian and Frans Hals -- Hawthorne admired the rich tonality of color, the monumentality and beauty of representation, and the nobility of subjects depicted, and imported them into his paintings of ordinary people for whom he felt sympathy or admiration: Portuguese fishermen, the selectmen and selectwomen of Provincetown, the fishmonger, the captain's wife, mothers and children.</p></p><p>ANT</p><h2>Invitation to Theology: A Guide to Study, Conversation Practice</h2><p>Are you intimidated by theology? Confused? Bored? Michael Jinkins knows it doesn't have to be that way. "Theology is our critical and prayerful reflection on the totality of life," he writes. "We all do theology on a regular basis, whether or not we are conscious of the fact." In <em>Invitation to Theology</em> Jinkins offers a knowledgeable, helpful and caring guide to walk you through the basics of the Christian faith. Following the pattern of the ancient summary of the Christian faith, the Apostles' Creed, Jinkins highlights the key doctrines of God, Jesus Christ, the Holy Spirit, humanity, church, salvation and resurrection. He cuts a clear path through theological terms, traditions and debates. And in the spirit of C. S. Lewis, he invites you to consider some of the most profound reflections--from the distant past to the present day--on Christian belief. Throughout this fascinating journey, the main road is always kept in view: "The meaning and shape of our life together as a community of persons is grounded in the inner life of God, the Trinity, and has been revealed to us in the life, death and resurrection of Jesus Christ." If you are eager to think about your faith, to examine what and why you believe and to reflect on how such faith can be lived out in our world, <em>Invitation to Theology</em> is the book for you.</p><p>Michael Jinkins is President and Professor of Theology at Louisville Presbyterian Theological Seminary. Previously he served as Dean of the Faculty and Professor of Pastoral Theology at Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary, after having served as pastor of several congregations. His books include <em>Called to be Human</em> (Eerdmans); <em>Letters to New Pastors</em> (Eerdmans); <em>Invitation to Psalms</em> (Abingdon); <em>Christianity, Tolerance and Pluralism</em> (Routledge Press); <em>The Church Faces Death: Ecclesiology in a Postmodern Context</em> (Oxford University Press) and <em>In the House of the Lord: Inhabiting the Psalms of Lament</em> (Liturgical Press)."Michael Jinkins has provided us with an accessible and readable theological primer. His lively introduction to the central doctrines of the Christian faith is born of a conviction that theology matters deeply not merely for a small professional group but for the whole people of God. This book is likely to be used and valued by many, particularly within the Reformed tradition." (David Fergusson, Professor of Divinity, New College, University of Edinburgh, Scotland)<br><br>"I heartily endorse Michael Jinkins's <em>Invitation to Theology.</em> Eminently readable, Jinkins provides a fresh, even elegant, articulation of core doctrines of the faith in a lively and engaging style. His imaginative analogies and helpful penchant for interrelating doctrines breathe an energizing vitality into theological reflection. Jinkins portrays doctrinal issues in ways both savvy to historical context and also engaging of readers 'where they live.' Most attractive to me is the trinitarian/christological lens through which all key doctrines are viewed. At last we have a survey that regards the Trinity not merely as an addendum or a part of the chapter on the doctrine of God but as integrally woven into the whole fabric of the theological tapestry, giving refreshing cohesion to every doctrine. I have long awaited such an unapologetically trinitarian-angled book for use as a text in my Christian doctrine classes." (Jeannine Michele Graham, Assistant Professor of Religion, Whitworth College)<br><br>"Michael Jinkins is offering much more than a basic theological text book on the Creed; he is presenting an approach to theology and theological learning which comes out of his experience as a teacher of adults in seminary and Sunday school. I warmly commend this exciting resource for group learning and agree with Jinkins's conviction that doing theology is a community activity with a practical end. Those who immerse themselves in this course, in the conversations with great thinkers of the past, and in the creative thinking and exploration that is encouraged can hardly fail to have a clearer understanding of the fundamentals of their faith. As the course is designed to be done as a community activity, the hope and expectation is that with a renewed grasp of the gospel, there will be a fruitful renewal of the life of the church. Read as a text by individuals, the attractive prose and clarity of presentation should inspire group use and collaborative learning. Dr. Jinkins's book deserves to be widely read and used." (The Rev. Canon Dr. Vincent Strudwick, Director of Theology Programmes Department for Continuing Education, University of Oxford, Fellow of Kellogg College)<br><br>"Michael Jinkins's invitation to theology is lively, fresh and reader friendly. Centered on the trinitarian love of God as source of new life in communion with God and others, Jinkins's book ties together Christian doctrine, worship and service, and helpfully exposes the destructiveness of modern individualism in both church and society. An excellent choice for a first course in theology!" (Daniel L. Migliore, Charles Hodge Professor of Systematic Theology, Princeton Theological Seminary)<br><br>"I'm glad that I accepted Michael Jinkins's invitation to study theology with him. Jinkins makes good on his promise that theological study will come alive when it helps us to see our world--and our own lives in that world--through the reality of the living Christ." (Richard J. Mouw, President and Professor of Christian Philosophy, Fuller Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Jinkins here invites us to participate in both the joys and the challenges of the theological task. With the expectancy of a colleague proposing a new approach to an old question, he draws us into conversation with the figures, themes and problematics of the Christian tradition. With the guiding hand of a good teacher, he reminds us that the work of theology should not be undertaken lightly. Students and laypeople new to the discipline will especially benefit from Jinkins's creative balance of 'lectures' and 'homework assignments,' all geared to train us to be theologians--to better know and bear witness to the character of God." (Cynthia L. Rigby, Associate Professor of Systematic Theology, Austin Presbyterian Theological Seminary)<br><br>"Michael Jinkins has the rare gift of making complex theological doctrines accessible to laypeople and beginning theological students without 'dumbing down.' In this book he interprets Christian doctrine with the cheerful and joyful good humor that is appropriate for a theology that has to do with the good news of God in Jesus Christ. An especially helpful feature of the book is the way it encourages teachers and students to learn together to relate the implications of the Christian faith for everyday life."

We see sunlit spaces; the glimmer of satin, silver, and linen; we see the softness of a hand on a lute string or letter. We recognize the distilled impression of a moment of time; and we feel it to be real.<br>We might hope for some answers from the experts, but they are confounded too. Even with the modern technology available, they do not know why there is no evidence of any preliminary drawing; why there are shifts in focus; and why his pictures are unusually blurred. Some wonder if he might possibly have used a camera obscura to capture what he saw before him. The few traces Vermeer has left behind tell us little: there are no letters or diaries; and no reports of him at work.<br><br>Jane Jelley has taken a new path in this detective story. A painter herself, she has worked with the materials of his time: the cochineal insect and lapis lazuli; the sheep bones, soot, earth, and rust. She shows us how painters made their pictures layer by layer; she investigates old secrets; and hears travelers' tales. She explores how Vermeer could have used a lens in the creation of his masterpieces. <br><br>The clues were there all along. After all this time, now we can unlock the studio door, and catch a glimpse of Vermeer inside, painting light.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jane Jelley </strong>is a painter, specializing in still life and landscape, who became intrigued by the unusual qualities of Vermeer's pictures, and the lively arguments about whether he used a camera obscura. Familiar with traditional materials, Jane decided to find out for herself whether there was a practical way to transfer an images from a lens to a canvas, and she published a paper about her experiments in 2013. Jane lives and works in Oxford.<br><br>"Featuring wonderful illustrations, engaging prose, and a deep knowledge of the craft, this is a study in art history and methodology to delight an audience beyond just visual artists." - <em>Kirkus</em>, Starred Review <br><p></p><br>"Artist Jane Jelley probed the issue pragmatically. Before assessing any use of camera obscura, she investigates the tools, materials and studio Vermeer was known to have used, and his virtuosic layering of paint." - <em>Nature</em> <br><p></p><br>"I find this revelatory and wholly convincing. Jelley devotes a chapter to the history of art innovation, in a Netherlands that was the California of its day, and explores it in depth." - <em>The Guardian</em> <br><p></p><br>"A fascinating exercise and assay, <em>Traces of Vermeer</em> (Oxford) serves as an elucidating technical accompaniment to the broader scope of Vermeer in Detail... Jelley's engaging prose is a boon to both scholars and casual art appreciators." - <em>Politics &amp; Prose</em> <br><p></p><br>"<em>Traces of Vermeer</em>, a meaty and intensely interesting new book by Jane Jelley... Through her own understanding of the craft, she comes as close as anybody can to understanding both the mechanics and the inner lives of masterpieces like 'A Lady Writing,' 'Young Woman with a Water Jug,' 'A Woman Holding a Balance,' or 'Girl with a Pearl Earring.' And she's bluntly honest enough to acknowledge repeatedly that these investigations only reach so far." - <em>Christian Science Monitor</em> <br><p></p><br>"First, it should be noted that her writing is elegant and clear, and she accurately summarizes much of the scholarly background on Vermeer, his home life, the Dutch Golden Age, and more. She has deep historical and practical knowledge of pigments, supports, and mixing practices likely used by Vermeer." - <em>Leonardo</em> <br><p></p><br>"To be sure, <em>Traces of Vermeer</em> is an invitation for us to not only embrace Vermeer's world, but to also ask or decipher to what degree he may, or may not have used some sort of lens through a camera obscura." - <em>David Marx Book Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"This is not another speculative Vermeer biography, a fill-in-the-gaps, guesswork life. This is Vermeer the painter, by a painter.... Jelley's meticulous approach yields fascinating insights.'" - <em>Literary Review</em> <br><p></p><br>"Well-researched... vivid... fascinating." - <em>Tablet</em> <br><p></p><br>"Magnificent." - <em>Al Femminile</em> <br><p></p><br>"A fascinating approach that throws up a plethora of intriguing details that add to the texture of Vermeer's life and technique... Jelley's ingenious experiment offer[s] a plausible suggestion as to how he set about his magical paintings." - <em>Sunday Times</em> <br><p></p><br>"An absolute delight. A rich and highly original exploration of Vermeer's life and work seen through the eyes of a practising painter." - Professor Sir Barry Cunliffe<p></p><br>"Jane Jelley adds a unique perspective on Vermeer's techniques and style." - Johan Wagemans, University of Leuven <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Overtraining in Sport</h2><p><p><i>Overtraining in Sport</i> is the first comprehensive text on the physiological, biomedical, and psychological aspects of overtraining and overreaching in sport.

A critical aspect of this approach is the cultural tools or &#x201c;mediational means&#x201d; that shape both social and individual processes. In considering how these mediational means&#x2015;in particular, language&#x2015;emerge in social history and the role they play in organizing the settings in which human beings are socialized, Wertsch achieves fresh insights into essential areas of human mental functioning that are typically unexplored or misunderstood.</p><p>Although Wertsch&#x2019;s discussion draws on the work of a variety of scholars in the social sciences and the humanities, the writings of two Soviet theorists, L. S. Vygotsky (1896&#x2013;1934) and Mikhail Bakhtin (1895&#x2013;1975), are of particular significance. <i>Voices of the Mind</i> breaks new ground in reviewing and integrating some of their major theoretical ideas and in demonstrating how these ideas can be extended to address a series of contemporary issues in psychology and related fields.</p><p>A case in point is Wertsch&#x2019;s analysis of &#x201c;voice,&#x201d; which exemplifies the collaborative nature of his effort. Although some have viewed abstract linguistic entities, such as isolated words and sentences, as the mechanism shaping human thought, Wertsch turns to Bakhtin, who demonstrated the need to analyze speech in terms of how it &#x201c;appropriates&#x201d; the voices of others in concrete sociocultural settings. These appropriated voices may be those of specific speakers, such as one&#x2019;s parents, or they may take the form of &#x201c;social languages&#x201d; characteristic of a category of speakers, such as an ethnic or national community. Speaking and thinking thus involve the inherent process of &#x201c;ventriloquating&#x201d; through the voices of other socioculturally situated speakers. <i>Voices of the Mind</i> attempts to build upon this theoretical foundation, persuasively arguing for the essential bond between cognition and culture.</p></p><p>James V. Wertsch is Professor and Chair of the Department of Psychology, Clark University.&#x201c;<i>Voices of the Mind</i> is a concise, creative integration of several major theories concerning the fundamentally social nature of human thought. It has special appeal to readers interested in theories of learning and the relationship between culture and cognition as it is played out in the course of everyday life.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b><i>Harvard Educational Review</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Wertsch has a lucid understanding of Vygotsky&#x2019;s and Bakhtin&#x2019;s ideas, and his transitions from one concept to another are smooth, clearly presented, and supported with examples... <i>Voices</i> has many insights to offer that are not often encountered in the literature on rhetoric and composition. Moreover, Wertsch holds true to the sociocultural approach&#x2019;s holistic nature, grounding his research on theory and his theory on research.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>John Scenters-Zapico</b><b>, </b><b><i>Rhetoric Science Quarterly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Wertsch...has again written a major contribution to psychological, social, and educational sciences... In his previous books, he has been an interpreter. In this new book he has begun to assemble his own theory into a single volume. The range of literature cited and used is impressive, and the scholarship enviable... It will be a key volume in the emergent debates of the 1990s in several disciplines.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Ronald Gallimore, School of Medicine, University of California, Los Angeles</b><br><br>&#x201c;The book&#x2019;s goal, to my mind beautifully achieved, is to delineate a &#x2018;sociocultural approach to mind&#x2019;... Wertsch begins by defining a unit of analysis that sees the human being not as passive receptor and not as individual isolate but rather as generator of a certain type of action&#x2015;what [he] calls &#x2018;communicative&#x2019; action or &#x2018;individuals acting with mediational means.&#x2019;&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Caryl Emerson, Princeton University</b><br><br>&#x201c;This is a magisterial exercise in social theory, with immediate implications for practical action in a number of disciplines that cut across the spectrum of the social and human sciences, from psychology and anthropology to history and literary criticism. Concentrating on behavior, on action, as his unit of analysis, Wertsch engages everyday problems of great immediacy and urgency, while sacrificing nothing to theoretical elegance or conceptual rigor.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Michael Holquist, Yale University</b><br><br>&#x201c;Wertsch develops Vygotsky&#x2019;s ideas about a semiotic approach to culture in a direction that was central for Vygotsky but has received comparatively little attention from his followers. The most inspiring result of Wertsch&#x2019;s effort is that the idea of the &#x2018;multivoicedness&#x2019; of human mind, corresponding to the multivoicedness of both culture and communication, is introduced into psychology. Wertsch has created a theoretical and methodological framework which is of genuine help to those studying ways in which culture shapes mind.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Peeter Tulviste, University of Tartu, Estonia</b></p><h2>Progressions With Readings: Paragraphs to Essay</h2><p>Normal 0 false false false MicrosoftInternetExplorer4 Serving as a rhetoric, reader, and handbook, Progressions provides unusually extensive support for the student by specifically showing what to do in every step of the writing process.

He revolutionized the newspaper industry in America, becoming the most powerful media mogul the world had ever seen, and in the process earned himself the title of "most hated man in America" on four different occasions. <br>Now in the second volume of this sweeping biography, Ben Procter gives readers a vivid portrait of the final 40 years of Hearst's life. Drawing on previously unavailable letters and manuscripts, and quoting generously from Hearst's own editorials, Procter covers all aspects of Hearst's career: his journalistic innovations, his impassioned patriotism, his fierce belief in "Government by Newspaper," his frustrated political aspirations, profligate spending and voracious art collecting, the building of his castle at San Simeon, and his tumultuous Hollywood years. The book offers new insight into Hearst's bitter and highly public quarrels with Al Smith (who referred to Hearst papers as "Mudgutter Gazettes") and FDR (whose New Deal Hearst dubbed the "Raw Deal"); his 30-year affair with the actress Marion Davies (and her own affairs with others); his political evolution from a progressive trust-buster and "America first" isolationist to an increasingly conservative and at times hysterical anti-communist. Procter also explores Hearst's ill-considered meeting with Hitler, his attempts to suppress "Citizen Kane," and his relationships with Joseph Kennedy, Charles Lindbergh, Louis B. Meyer, and many other major figures of his time. <br>As <em>Life</em> magazine noted, Hearst newspapers were a "one-man fireworks display"--sensational, controversial, informative, and always entertaining. In Ben Procter's fascinating biography, Hearst shines forth in all his eccentric and egocentric glory.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ben Procter</strong> is Professor of History at Texas Christian University and the author of <em>Not Without Honor: The Life of John H. Reagan, Battle of the Alamo, Just One Riot</em>, and <em>William Randolph Hearst: The Early Years, 1863-1910</em>. He lives in Fort Worth, Texas.<br>In the second and final installment of Hearst's biography, Procter (<i>Not Without Honor: The Life of John H. Reagan</i>) attempts to humanize the reigning avatar of American media tycoonism. This is no easy task. Hearst's lavish and exotic tastes, his romantic juggling acts, his voracious appetite for anything that cost money and his ruthless pursuit of political office easily congeal into cartoonish self-parody. Procter, a history professor at Texas Christian University, proves that Hearst's intentions were pure&#x2014;he genuinely wanted to improve the lives of all Americans. The focal point of the mogul's last 40 years is an unshakable political curse. Never internalizing the art of compromise, Hearst failed again and again to parlay his national newspaper puissance into political capital. He had a great knack for making, embellishing and fabricating the news, but no talent for anticipating it, as he continually dug his heels into the historically wrong side of all the big issues&#x2014;from U.S. involvement in WWI and WWII to Roosevelt's New Deal. Revelatory research into the finer points of Hearst's protean political alliances is rich in detail, as is his infamous meeting with Hitler, but the author delivers the same summaries over and over again. <i>(May)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

With a keen historical perspective on the most consequential social phenomenon of the twentieth century, Tara Zahra shows how the policies that gave shape to this migration provided the precedent for future events such as the Holocaust, the closing of the Iron Curtain, and the tragedies of ethnic cleansing. In the epilogue, she places the current refugee crisis within the longer history of migration.</p></p><p><strong>Tara Zahra</strong> is a professor of modern European history at the University of Chicago and a winner of the MacArthur Fellowship.

Full of hope and promise, of desperation and tragedy, it is perhaps the most important story of the twentieth century.

Why is violence often used to achieve religious, cultural or political goals? Can we understand the search for the extreme that increasingly shapes violence today? <br>&nbsp;<br>From 1960s student movements to today's global jihad, this text explores the factors and debates shaping violence and terrorism in our contemporary society. Each chapter confronts examples of disturbing terrorist acts and events of mass violence from recent history and uses these to examine key questions, theories and concepts surrounding this sensitive and controversial topic. In particular, the book:<br><br>- identifies core tools for the analysis of public violence <br>- explores the processes that mutate social movements into violent groups<br>- describes the cultural, embodied, experiential and imagined dimensions of violence<br>- highlights different periods and varying forms of terrorist violence <br>- examines the role of globalization, media, technology and the visual in violence and terror today.<br><br><i>Our Violent World</i> shows how the social sciences can contribute to an understanding of violence and responses to terror, as well as the construction of a social world less dominated by fear of the other.

Through a series of brilliant epiphanies that parallel the development of his own aesthetic consciousness, Joyce evokes Stephen's youth, from his impressionable years as the youngest student at the Clongowed Wood school to the deep religious conflict he experiences at a day school in Dublin, and finally to his college studies where he challenges the conventions of his upbringing and his understanding of faith and intellectual freedom. James Joyce's highly autobiographical novel was first published in the United States in 1916 to immediate acclaim. Ezra Pound accurately predicted that Joyce's book would "remain a permanent part of English literature," while H.G. Wells dubbed it "by far the most important living and convincing picture that exists of an Irish Catholic upbringing." A remarkably rich study of a developing young mind, <i>A Portrait Of The Artist As A Young Man</i> made an indelible mark on literature and confirmed Joyce's reputation as one of the world's greatest and lasting writers.<p>Like much of James Joyce's work, <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i> is a fictional re-creation of the Irish writer's own life and early environment. The experiences of the novel's young hero, Stephen Dedalus, unfold in astonishingly vivid scenes that seem freshly recalled from life and provide a powerful portrait of the coming of age of a young man of unusual intelligence, sensitivity, and character.<br>The interest of the novel is deepened by Joyce's telling portrayals of an Irish upbringing and schooling, the Catholic Church and its priesthood, Parnell and Irish politics, encounters with the conflicting roles of art and morality (problems that would follow Joyce throughout his life), sexual experimentation and its aftermath, and the decision to leave Ireland.<br>Rich in details that offer vital insights into Joyce's art, this masterpiece of semiautobiographical fiction remains essential reading in any program of study in modern literature.</p></p><h2>The Wisdom of Coaching: Essential Papers in Consulting Psychology for a World of Change</h2><p>What is executive coaching?

The authors cover the basics of risk management in the context of project management, and outline a step-by-step approach. They then extend this approach into specialised areas of procurement (including tender evaluation, outsourcing and Public-Private Partnerships), introducing technical risk assessment tools and processes for environmental risk management. Finally they consider quantitative methods and the way they can be used in large projects. International case studies are included throughout.</p><p>Managing risk is important to the success of any project. In large-scale or complex situations it becomes critical. <p>This book focuses on principles, practices and techniques for effective risk management in complex and large-scale projects and procurements. Chapter by chapter, the authors present simple, practical steps and illustrate them with examples drawn from their extensive experience across different countries, sectors, cultures and project phases.

It was the best selling printed work and dominated the print trade until the mid-nineteenth century. Sermons were highly influential in religious and spiritual matters, but they also played important roles in elections and politics, science and ideas and campaigns for reform. Sermons touched the lives of ordinary people and formed a dominant part of their lives. Preachers attracted huge crowds and the popular demand for sermons was never higher. Sermons were also taken by missionaries and clergy across the British empire, so that preaching was integral to the process of imperialism and shaped the emerging colonies and dominions. The form that sermons took varied widely, and this enabled preaching to be adopted and shaped by every denomination, so that in this period most religious groups could lay claim to a sermon style. The pulpit naturally lent itself to controversy, and consequently sermons lay at the heart of numerous religious arguments.<br><br>Drawing on the latest research by leading sermon scholars, this handbook accesses historical, theological, rhetorical, literary and linguistic studies to demonstrate the interdisciplinary strength of the field of sermon studies and to show the centrality of sermons to religious life in this period.<br></p><p><br><strong>Keith Francis</strong> is a historian of religion in Britain in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries and is particularly interested in the development of the biological sciences and their impact on nineteenth-century Christianity.

The text of the plays, with the Signet footnotes, is supplemented with bibliographies and a chronology of Shak espeare''s life &amp; times. '</p><p>James was writing as a late nineteenth-century novelist. Not so very many years before this, in the 1870s, another Victorian, Edward Dowden, was the first to designate Shakespeare&#39;s Last Plays as &#39;Romances&#39;. By then the word had acquired a lot of semantically blurred luggage since the time it simply meant a tale in a vernacular Romantic language--&#39;Isn&#39;t it romantic?&#39; is not the sort of question worth going into here. The Elizabethans and Jacobeans used the word of stories but not of dramas. Shakespeare never used the word at all--not of plays, not of anything.William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon in April 1564, and his birth is traditionally celebrated on April 23. The facts of his life, known from surviving documents, are sparse. He was one of eight children born to John Shakespeare, a merchant of some standing in his community. William probably went to the King&#x2019;s New School in Stratford, but he had no university education. In November 1582, at the age of eighteen, he married Anne Hathaway, eight years his senior, who was pregnant with their first child, Susanna. She was born on May 26, 1583. Twins, a boy, Hamnet ( who would die at age eleven), and a girl, Judith, were born in 1585. By 1592 Shakespeare had gone to London working as an actor and already known as a playwright. A rival dramatist, Robert Greene, referred to him as &#x201c;an upstart crow, beautified with our feathers.&#x201d; Shakespeare became a principal shareholder and playwright of the successful acting troupe, the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men (later under James I, called the King&#x2019; s Men). In 1599 the Lord Chamberlain&#x2019;s Men built and occupied the Globe Theater in Southwark near the Thames River. Here many of Shakespeare&#x2019;s plays were performed by the most famous actors of his time, including Richard Burbage, Will Kempe, and Robert Armin. In addition to his 37 plays, Shakespeare had a hand in others, including&nbsp;<i>Sir Thomas More</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Two Noble Kinsmen</i>, and he wrote poems, including&nbsp;<i>Venus and Adonis</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>The Rape of Lucrece</i>. His 154 sonnets were published, probably without his authorization, in 1609. In 1611 or 1612 he gave up his lodgings in London and devoted more and more time to retirement in Stratford, though he continued writing such plays as&nbsp;<i>The Tempest</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Henry VII</i>&nbsp;until about 1613. He died on April 23, 1616, and was buried in Holy Trinity Church, Stratford. No collected edition of his plays was published during his life-time, but in 1623 two members of his acting company, John Heminges and Henry Condell, put together the great collection now called the First Folio.</p><h2>Economics</h2><p>Steve Slavin's lively and comprehensive <i>Economics</i> 11e has a student-friendly, step-by-step approach.

They are waiting for an orphan boy to help with the work at Green Gables - but a skinny, red-haired girl turns up instead. Feisty and full of spirit, Anne Shirley charms her way into the Cuthberts&#39; affection with her vivid imagination and constant chatter. It&#39;s not long before Anne finds herself in trouble, but soon it becomes impossible for the Cuthberts to imagine life without &#39;their&#39; Anne - and for the people of Avonlea to recall what it was like before this wildly creative little girl whirled into town.</p><p>When Marilla and Matthew Cuthbert of Green Gables, Prince Edward Island, send for a boy orphan to help them out at the farm, they are in no way prepared for the error that will change their lives. The mistake takes the shape of Anne Shirley, a redheaded 11-year-old girl who can talk anyone under the table. Fortunately, her sunny nature and quirky imagination quickly win over her reluctant foster parents. Anne's feisty spirit soon draws many friends--and much trouble--her way. Not a day goes by without some melodramatic new episode in the tragicomedy of her life. Early on, Anne declares her eternal antipathy for Gilbert Blythe, a classmate who commits the ultimate sin of mocking her hair color. Later, she accidentally dyes that same cursed hair green. Another time, in her haste to impress a new neighbor, she bakes a cake with liniment instead of vanilla. Lucy Maud Montgomery's series of books about Anne have remained classics since the early 20th century. Her portrayal of this feminine yet independent spirit has given generations of girls a strong female role model, while offering a taste of another, milder time in history.

Writing against the Cartesian tradition and in praise of empiricism, he demonstrates repeatedly, and lyrically, the sterility of systems of knowledge divorced from bodily experience. <br>The fragile empirical world, long resistant to our attempts to contain and catalog it, is disappearing beneath the relentless accumulations of late capitalist society and information technology. Data has replaced sensory pleasure, we are less interested in the taste of a fine wine than in the description on the bottle's label. What are we, and what do we really know, when we have forgotten that our senses can describe a taste more accurately than language ever could?</p></p><p>Michel Serres is a Professor in the History of Science at Stanford University and a member of the Acad�mie Fran�aise.

It describes fundamental concepts of programming languages by presenting design issues of the various language constructs, examining the design choices for these constructs in a few common languages, and critically comparing the design alternatives. This book allows those with the ability to program to learn how to choose appropriate languages for certain tasks, increase their abilities to learn new languages, and understand the significance of implementation. It illustrates various language constructs and design alternatives through Java, JavaScript, C++, C, Ada, and Fortran, and intertwines discussions of object-oriented programming material with the discussions of the non-OO imperative languages. It also provides extensive material on semantics. This new edition is updated to include a new chapter covering parsing, new material on JavaScript, and updated material on Java 1.3. This book is suitable for programmers who want to get into the theory behind programming-language development and utilization.<b>Robert Sebesta</b> is an Associate Professor in the Computer Science Department at the University of Colorado, Colorado Springs.

History of Biblical Interpretation starts at 150 BCE and moves to the present in exploring the major developments and principal approaches to interpreting the Bible. Thirty-four chapters survey the most significant methods and provide introductions to the prominent people who exemplify them. Each chapter also presents an original document that demonstrates this person&#x2019;s interpretational approach and includes a reference bibliography for further reading. Whether used as a textbook or in individual study, this excellent introduction to the history of biblical interpretation will open new doors for students of the Bible, theology, and church history.</p><p>"Yarchin&#x2019;s History of Biblical Interpretation provides students, scholars, and interested lay readers with a sorely needed collection of writings devoted to the interpretation of biblical literature from Greco-Roman times through the present. Unlike other works, this volume does not simply discuss the history of biblical interpretation. Instead, Yarchin presents the reader with a virtual cornucopia of examples from the extraordinarily rich history of biblical interpretation in both the Jewish and Christian traditions. The volume includes examples from the Dead Sea Scrolls, Philo, Justin Martyr, Augustine, the early Syrian Church, the Jerusalem Talmud, Saadiah Gaon, John Calvin, Moses Mendelssohn, Hermann Gunkel, Brevard Childs, Jon Levenson, Phyllis Trible, and many more. Yarchin&#x2019;s volume will become an indispensable textbook and resource for all concerned with the interpretation of the Bible." <br>&#x2014;Marvin A. Sweeney, Professor of Hebrew Bible, Claremont School of Theology <p>"The essays Yarchin has selected for the book are well chosen to represent the numerous diverse strategies for reading the Bible beginning with the second century BCE through the present day. His introduction to the book, a history of Biblical interpretation in Jewish and Christian contexts, and his helpful introductions to each essay in the volume are written in clear and concise prose at a level for the general reader. Where the language of a given essay may be technical or otherwise unclear, Yarchin clarifies with notes and parenthetical explanations. He neither advocates one method over another nor critiques methods as to strengths and weaknesses. His introductions to the essays are geared to facilitate a reader&#x2019;s understanding of the strategy in its historical context, and his bibliography with each essay guides the reader to additional information on the method. The book is a wonderful resource for the classroom and provides a literary laboratory for student discussion of method and strategy in reading the Bible. Having representative essays of the major turning points in the history of biblical interpretation assembled in a one-volume reader should also facilitate the discussion of methods in the guild by making materials, particularly the older essays, easily accessible. Some of the essays are here translated into English for the first time. Yarchin is a reliable and unbiased guide through the rather complex and argumentative history of biblical interpretation.

May it remain in print for a very long time."--<i>Review of Biblical Literature<br></i><br>"As biblical scholarship moves from a modern to a postmodern context, increasing attention is being paid to a range of hermeneutical issues. Yarchin's contribution to the present transition is well timed, lucid, and even practical. . . . The reader is literally drawn into the 'story' of interpretation in a way few textbooks can match."--<i>Catholic Biblical Quarterly<br></i><br>"This is a useful reader. It gathers together numerous significant texts on biblical interpretation into a handy compendium of some of the most important movements in biblical interpretation in the last 2,000 years. . . . [It] is likely to become a standard textbook for all who are interested in the history of biblical interpretation."--<i>Journal for the Study of the New Testament<br></i><br>"This is a very valuable reader, providing lengthy and representative passages from writers on biblical interpretation from the earliest times. . . . The selection is judicious and helpful. Yarchin provides excellent introductions and notes to the selections, studiously avoiding any evaluative comments and concentrating on helping the reader to understand the necessary background. There is also an excellent general introduction. Altogether an admirable book, which should be useful in courses on interpretation."--<i>Journal for the Study of the Old Testament</i></p>
